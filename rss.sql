Back in 2011, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-fashion-directors-exit-could-mean-entry-of-adult-supervision-2011-11">Tumblr''s sponsorship efforts were a joke</a>. It only <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-will-start-selling-ad-units-on-may-2-2012-4">began taking ad dollars a year ago</a>. <br /><br />More recently, however, Tumblr has taken several steps that show it is serious about monetizing its <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/17/users-stay-longer-on-tumblr-than-facebook/">90 million daily posts from its 100 million bloggers</a>. A lot of them are reminiscent of Facebook''s path to its IPO, and after that the acquisition of Instagram:</p> <ul> <li>Tumblr has started <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/2264915/tumblr-turns-to-mobile-ads-as-pressure-mounts-for-greater-revenue">offering sponsored posts</a> in the feeds of mobile users, just like Facebook does with "sponsored stories."</li> <li>It hired a new <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-just-poached-its-new-head-of-global-ad-sales-from-groupon-2012-9">head of ad sales, Lee Brown, from Groupon</a>. When Facebook hired Carolyn Everson as head of its ad sales, from <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, it changed the way ad agencies viewed the site &mdash;&nbsp;and money poured in.</li> <li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-12-creative-agencies-a-list-partnership-program-2012-11">Tumblr has named a Creative A-List</a> of agencies it likes to work with &mdash;&nbsp;a bit like Facebook''s Preferred Marketing Developer list of approved ad suppliers.</li> <li>Tumblr has begun to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/want-tumblr-analytics-here-is-the-absurd-price-youll-have-to-pay-2012-12">beef up its analytic offerings</a> &mdash;&nbsp;because advertisers don''t want to touch media if they can''t measure what they''re getting for their money.</li> <li>Tumblr suffers from the same initial problem advertisers had with Facebook: That once brands have made a few posts on their <a href="http://www.digiday.com/platforms/can-tumblr-reel-in-brands/">Tumblr, they get bored of using the free tools</a> and their activity drops off. Creating free content that''s cool and engaging is difficult and time consuming. It''s easier to just advertise and pay for the forced exposure.</li> <li>And advertisers have grumbled about not "getting"&nbsp; Tumblr, just as they used to about Facebook. Digiday reported, "One provider of social management tools said literally <a href="http://www.digiday.com/platforms/can-tumblr-reel-in-brands/">no clients had pushed for Tumblr to be included</a>. That&rsquo;s a major red flag."</li> </ul> <p>What most people misunderstand about Tumblr, and what Yahoo may feel is worth paying for, is that Tumblr is NOT best described as a "blogging platform."</p> <p>Sure, users have blogs on which they post things. But once you''re a Tumblr user, you find that the real fun of Tumblr is building a news feed that only you can see from other users you like. Want an all-skateboarding-all-the-time news feed? Tumblr. As members begin to follow each other, they start messaging each other.</p> <p>The real party on Tumblr is going on <em>behind</em> the dashboard, not on the blogs'' outer faces.</p> <p>That party is why Tumblr has become so big among young people &mdash;&nbsp;it''s basically a cool social hangout that their parents haven''t figured out yet.<br /><br />Tumblr''s dashboard feeds are obviously easy to monetize in the future, just as Facebook and Instagram''s friend feeds are and will be.<br /><br />Which is why $1 billion suddenly doesn''t seem completely crazy for a $13 million startup.</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-tumblrs-total-revenue-for-2012-and-how-it-will-make-a-profit-in-2013-2013-1" >Here''s Tumblr''s Total Revenue For 2012 — And How It Will Make A Profit In 2013</a></strong></p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/advertising">Advertising</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/BI_Advertising">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c10b867/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwhy-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5&t=Why+Yahoo+Might+Pay+%241.1+Billion+For+Tumblr+Even+Though+It+Only+Has+%2413+Million+In+Revenue+%28YHOO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwhy-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5&t=Why+Yahoo+Might+Pay+%241.1+Billion+For+Tumblr+Even+Though+It+Only+Has+%2413+Million+In+Revenue+%28YHOO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwhy-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5&t=Why+Yahoo+Might+Pay+%241.1+Billion+For+Tumblr+Even+Though+It+Only+Has+%2413+Million+In+Revenue+%28YHOO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwhy-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5&t=Why+Yahoo+Might+Pay+%241.1+Billion+For+Tumblr+Even+Though+It+Only+Has+%2413+Million+In+Revenue+%28YHOO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fwhy-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5&t=Why+Yahoo+Might+Pay+%241.1+Billion+For+Tumblr+Even+Though+It+Only+Has+%2413+Million+In+Revenue+%28YHOO%29" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664262832/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c10b867/kg/342-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664262832/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c10b867/kg/342-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165664262832/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c10b867/kg/342-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=J_QcBQwfDQ8:7f3xVAcaHDE:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/J_QcBQwfDQ8" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-18 03:07:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/why-yahoo-might-pay-1-billion-for-tumblr-2013-5', '2013-05-18 13:28:18'),

You understand this as well as I do.&nbsp;</p> <p>But damn it, it''s true. Last night, I caught a 9:45 p.m. <a href="http://www.imax.com/movies/m/star-trek-into-darkness-an-imax-3d-experience/" target="_blank">IMAX 3D showing of "Star Trek Into Darkness"</a> and it just reminded me how much more I enjoy watching the "Star Wars" movies. It kills me that I have to include Episodes I through III. Those aren''t "Star Wars" movies, they''re abominations. But in the spirit of fairness, I''ll count them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even counting the newer "Star Wars" installments, the franchise is still better than the "Star Trek" universe. Fightin'' words.&nbsp;</p> <p>The irony here is that new Trek-helmer <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/jj-abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> will be taking the reigns for the new "Star Wars," so this fight might dwindle in the next few years as "Star Wars" gets Abramified and lens-flared into the next decade.&nbsp;</p> <p>So let''s just enjoy the discussion for now because really, I know you get as much of a kick out of this "debate" as I do.</p> <p>Here are 19 reasons why "Star Wars" is better than "Star Trek." There are more, but I have some actual work to attend to, so please feel free to sound off in the comments below.&nbsp;</p><h3>19.

First it skirted the protracted battle over the Keystone XL pipeline, which could carry dirty tar sands oil from Canada to the American Gulf Coast. Now it&rsquo;s facing opposition to proposed fracking regulations on tens of millions of acres of government land.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Bureau of Land Management&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wo/Communications_Directorate/public_affairs/hydraulicfracturing.Par.91723.File.tmp/HydFrac_SupProposal.pdf">filed draft rules to govern the extraction of shale oil and gas</a> through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves injecting chemical-laced water into the ground to crack rock and force oil to the surface. The oil and gas regulations have not been updated since 1988, long before the new technology came along. The BLM currently manages 48,699 oil and gas leases on 38 million acres of federal land. Those wells produced $23 billion worth of oil and gas in 2012, earning $2.6 billion in royalty payments for the government.</p> <p>The proposals would allow drillers to skirt disclosures about the chemical composition of fracking fluid by claiming them as trade secrets. &ldquo;The revised proposed rule makes it clear that an operator should not disclose any information &hellip; that it believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Trade Secrets Act,&rdquo; the proposal states. Instead, well operators would file an affidavit claiming trade secret protection for the chemical after drilling&mdash;at which point, the deed is already done.</p> <p>The BLM also eliminated proposed disclosure requirements for so-called flowback fluids, which surface after drilling and must be disposed of in containment ponds or tanks.</p> <p>Environmentalists aren&rsquo;t happy. &ldquo;After reviewing the draft rules, we believe the administration is putting the American public&rsquo;s health and well-being at risk, while continuing to give polluters a free ride,&rdquo; <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/michael-brune">Michael Brune</a>, the Sierra Club&rsquo;s executive director, said in a statement. &ldquo;The last thing we should be doing is opening up still more public land to drilling and fracking.&rdquo;&nbsp;The Wilderness Society said the BLM should require flowback fluids to be stored in sturdier storage tanks rather than in lined ponds, which are eventually transferred to waste-water treatment facilities.</p> <p>According to the BLM, the proposed rules would not stand in the way of stricter state regulations. For instance, <a href="http://qz.com/82227/california-seems-likely-to-ban-fracking/">California, home to the nation&rsquo;s biggest shale oil reserves, is considering tighter rules</a>. The bigger the reserves, it seems, the bigger the reservations about fracking&rsquo;s fallout.</p> <p><strong>More from Quartz:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><a

Carson offers a few tips for how to upgrade your office, dress for the occasion, be aware of your tone, and avoid distractions.</p> <p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-the-sp-is-going-to-1715-2013-5"><strong>Tom Lee Thinks The S&amp;P 500 Is Going To 1715</strong></a> <strong>(<a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/jp-morgan">JP Morgan</a>)</strong></p> <p>This has been a better bull market than we expected, particularly in 2013.

Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds</a></em>, highlights inequality as one of six headwinds potentially reducing long-run economic growth.</p> <p>But which way does the causality run? In a speech yesterday, Raskin points to globalization and automation as reasons why&nbsp;some&nbsp;two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in middle-wage occupations, but those occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of the job growth during the recovery.&nbsp;By contrast, lower-wage occupations have accounted for only one-fifth of job losses during the recession but more than one-half of total job gains during the recovery.&nbsp;As such, Raskin says &ldquo;the earnings potential for many households likely remains below what they had anticipated in the years before the recession.&rdquo;</p> <p>So the middle part of the labor market is being hollowed out, what economists call &ldquo;job polarization.&rdquo;</p> <p><img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5196687beab8ea957800000b-637-414-590-/051713jobs1.jpg" border="0" alt="employment shares by skill level" width="590" /></p> <p>But is inequality hurting economic growth? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/10/18/shrink-inequality-to-grow-the-economy/inequality-may-not-restrain-growth-of-american-economy" target="_blank">Brookings scholar Scott Winship</a> has his doubts, telling the <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/new-york-times">New York Times</a>, &ldquo;The evidence does not give much reason to worry that inequality saps growth, or much reason to think that it increases it.&rdquo; Among his reasons:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. It seems that for authoritarian nations with emerging economies, but that relationship has been tough to pin down for democratic, advanced economies.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. A highly regarded 2010 study <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17896.pdf" target="_blank">Do Rising Incomes Lift All Boats </a>looking at data from 1905 to 2000 found &ldquo;no systematic relationship between top income shares and economic growth in a panel of 12 developed nations observed for between 22 and 85 years.&rdquo;</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. A March 2012 study by Michael Bordo and Christopher Meissner, <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17896.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Does Inequality Lead to a Financial Crisis</em></a>, concludes &ldquo;low interest rates and economic expansions are the only two robust determinants of credit booms in our data set. Anecdotal evidence from US experience in the 1920s and in the years up to 2007 and from other countries does not support the inequality, credit, crisis nexus. Rather, it points back to a familiar boom-bust pattern of declines in interest rates, strong growth, rising credit, asset price booms and crises.&rdquo;</p> <p>In Brink Lindsey&rsquo;s excellent new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B008N0OOPQ" target="_blank"><em>Human Capitalism</em></a>, he notes a disconnect between the demand for high-skill human capital and inability of society to widely provide a fertile environment for its development. &ldquo;Educational attainment has stalled, and the lowest skill jobs are increasing, not decreasing, their share of employment.&rdquo;</p> <p>He offers several ideas, which I will list briefly but promise to later explore in depth: 1) maintain economic growth by encouraging entrepreneurship, 2) reform K-12 education by unleashing competition, 3) compensate for disadvantaged environments through early childhood interventions, 4) combat social exclusion of low-skilled adults, 5) improve higher education by limiting tuition subsidies, 6) remove regulatory burdens to entrepreneurship and upward mobility. Rather than focus on the 1% per se, better to keep growth high and enhance the ability of more Americans to take part in a growing economy &mdash; which will boost growth further and create a virtuous circle.</p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/politics">Politics</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/bi_politics">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c1281c7/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fus-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5&t=No%2C+Inequality+Isn%27t+Preventing+A+US+Economic+Recovery" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fus-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5&t=No%2C+Inequality+Isn%27t+Preventing+A+US+Economic+Recovery" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fus-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5&t=No%2C+Inequality+Isn%27t+Preventing+A+US+Economic+Recovery" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fus-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5&t=No%2C+Inequality+Isn%27t+Preventing+A+US+Economic+Recovery" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fus-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5&t=No%2C+Inequality+Isn%27t+Preventing+A+US+Economic+Recovery" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=d04aycuMm0c:QOlXD-nDpfw:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/d04aycuMm0c" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-17 09:00:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-recovery-inequality-stats-2013-5', '2013-05-18 11:16:26'),
(121, 4, 'You Don''t Need Permission To Try Something Awesome — Just Do It', 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/businessinsider/~3/m1G7u7xrJno/how-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5', '<p><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5em;">Sometimes everybody around you is wrong. Frightfully, horrifically mistaken That&rsquo;s important to remember. One of the things business experts tell you when you are considering changes to your sales strategy is the idea that you need to &ldquo;listen to your marketplace&rdquo;. That you need to take your idea and run it by the people around you to get some feedback.</span></p> <p dir="ltr">These same experts will remind you that you need to &ldquo;give your industry what they want."&nbsp; Telling you&nbsp;that giving your industry what they want you will grow your company more quickly than anyone around you. More sales. More effective marketing.</p> <p dir="ltr">But there are a lot of problems with that line of thinking.</p> <p dir="ltr">Most of the time people don&rsquo;t know what they want. Business people. People who are husbands and wives. People who are athletes, politicians, and industry titans.&nbsp;They don&rsquo;t know exactly what they want.</p> <p dir="ltr">Big picture &mdash; they know what they want; but when it comes to the details, the exact way things are executed, there&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty. A lot still to be tried.</p> <blockquote> <p dir="ltr">If you give people what they want, you are usually only giving them what they think they want. Which is likely to change tomorrow and the day after and the day after that too.</p> </blockquote> <p dir="ltr">More importantly, sometimes people are wrong.</p> <p dir="ltr">Two hundred years ago southern businessmen thought that slavery was the best business strategy to drive economic gain. It was &ldquo;what they wanted."&nbsp; Besides the catastrophic personal impact on the slaves themselves, that line of thinking crippled the long term economic growth of the entire region.</p> <p dir="ltr">Because slavery uniquely relied on&nbsp;unrealistically&nbsp;inexpensive labor, southern businesses were much slower to innovate than their northern counterparts. If you were to ask a southern business leader what he wanted, he would give you religious and economic plausibility for more slaves.</p> <p dir="ltr">And that very strategy was morally and economically flawed.</p> <p dir="ltr">You don&rsquo;t get bonus points for being abrasive, abusive, or obnoxious. And you don&rsquo;t usually &ldquo;win&rdquo; by running around telling people how wrong they are. That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p> <p dir="ltr">Just remember that what people want isn&rsquo;t always what&rsquo;s best for them or for everyone else around them. Sometimes what they want turns out to be a horrific human tragedy. &nbsp;Along the way, you&rsquo;ll hear all the reasons why what they want is right, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to be the person who gives it to them.</p> <p dir="ltr">Instead, blaze a new trail. Think about where you want to lead your market. Your industry. The people around you. Think about where you want to go and then lead. Shepherd. Protect your vision.</p> <blockquote> <p dir="ltr">Martin Luther didn&rsquo;t ask for anyone else&rsquo;s opinions when he nailed his religious thesis on the door of All Saint&rsquo;s Church in 1517 and began a religious reformation that is felt all over the world to this day. Five hundred years later, <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</a> never asked you what you wanted in a better phone when he announced the first <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/iphone">iPhone</a> on June 29, 2007. They didn&rsquo;t care about &ldquo;what you wanted."</p> </blockquote> <p dir="ltr">They didn&rsquo;t ask permission. They lead with purpose. And passion.</p> <p dir="ltr">And we all followed.</p> <p dir="ltr">Because that&rsquo;s what we do when people take us to where we want to be. Not just lead us where we think we want to go.</p> <p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s something to think about the next time you feel like you need permission to try something awesome. Just do it.</p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/warroom">War Room</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/tbi_warroom">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c0fdd51/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fhow-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5&t=You+Don%27t+Need+Permission+To+Try+Something+Awesome+%E2%80%94+Just+Do+It" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fhow-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5&t=You+Don%27t+Need+Permission+To+Try+Something+Awesome+%E2%80%94+Just+Do+It" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fhow-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5&t=You+Don%27t+Need+Permission+To+Try+Something+Awesome+%E2%80%94+Just+Do+It" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fhow-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5&t=You+Don%27t+Need+Permission+To+Try+Something+Awesome+%E2%80%94+Just+Do+It" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fhow-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5&t=You+Don%27t+Need+Permission+To+Try+Something+Awesome+%E2%80%94+Just+Do+It" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664581677/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c0fdd51/kg/342-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664581677/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c0fdd51/kg/342-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165664581677/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c0fdd51/kg/342-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=m1G7u7xrJno:1p3ipREkrqM:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/m1G7u7xrJno" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-17 08:58:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-reinvent-a-business-strategy-2013-5', '2013-05-18 11:16:26'),

That&rsquo;s a simple message, but&rdquo; &mdash; he starts to hammer his hand against the table, punctuating his words with raps &mdash; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very&thinsp;&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;very&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;tough.&rdquo; After a pause, he lets his hand lay flat.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;I always try to communicate to our people that we can never make enough money,&rdquo; Oberhelman continues. &ldquo;We can never make enough profit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>That''s a great business answer. But it ignores the human reality of constantly pushing wages and benefits downward.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>One worker <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-16/caterpillars-doug-oberhelman-manufacturings-mouthpiece#p4">told Businessweek</a> that some of his coworkers have to depend on food-stamps to support their families.</li> <li>In non-union plants in the south, another worker says that they''re "<span>basically expendable" because there are five people who want the job.&nbsp;</span></li> <li>As the company continued to squeeze workers, Oberhelman''s pay rose 60% to over $16 million in 2011, and to more than $22 million last year.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-16/caterpillars-doug-oberhelman-manufacturings-mouthpiece#p4">Kimes highlights the disconnect</a> with an interesting anecdote. During the strike in Joliet, workers were invited to a meeting with the CEO. One employee asked when hourly workers could expect a raise, and Oberhelman responded by using his salary as an example about competitive wages, pointing out that he makes less than the CEOs at some smaller competitors. That employee, a single father who says he hasn''t gotten a raise in over a decade, was "stunned."</p> <p>The company argues that it needs to plan for the possibility of hard times ahead.</p> <p>Manufacturing companies routinely complain that there''s not enough skilled labor. However, there''s not much incentive to devote your life to manufacturing if wages remain extremely low.</p> <p>There''s also an ongoing effort <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/american-parents-obsession-with-status-is-keeping-kids-unemployed-2013-2">to reform the public view</a> of manufacturing from providing low paying jobs that leave you with dirty fingernails to something more technical and almost white collar. There are some of those jobs, but a hostile relationship with workers is no way to attract them.</p> <p>It''s an paradox. A growing company creates more jobs and more welfare. And wages need to stay low enough that companies aren''t forced to move outside the United States to remain competitive.</p> <p>But there''s a difference between doing what you need to do to beat the competition, and treating workers like they''re an expense to be minimized for the good of shareholders.</p> <p>At the end of the day, wages aren''t going to go up until growth is strong enough to demand it, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-16/caterpillars-doug-oberhelman-manufacturings-mouthpiece#p4">Oberhelman says</a>. That kind of growth would be good for both companies'' bottom lines and workers'' wallets.&nbsp;</p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/warroom">War Room</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/tbi_warroom">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/caterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c124060/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fcaterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5&t=Caterpillar+CEO%3A+%27We+Can+Never+Make+Enough+Profit%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fcaterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5&t=Caterpillar+CEO%3A+%27We+Can+Never+Make+Enough+Profit%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fcaterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5&t=Caterpillar+CEO%3A+%27We+Can+Never+Make+Enough+Profit%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fcaterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5&t=Caterpillar+CEO%3A+%27We+Can+Never+Make+Enough+Profit%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fcaterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5&t=Caterpillar+CEO%3A+%27We+Can+Never+Make+Enough+Profit%27" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664267044/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c124060/kg/342-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664267044/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c124060/kg/342-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165664267044/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c124060/kg/342-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7_tSG-56LFQ:ciHCryvKx_s:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/7_tSG-56LFQ" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-17 08:48:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/caterpillar-ceo-quote-on-workers-2013-5', '2013-05-18 11:16:26'),
(124, 4, 'The 10 Best Horse Names Of All Time', 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/businessinsider/~3/ZigP2haKxEo/10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5', '<p><span>The Preakness is on Saturday. These are the 10 best horse names ever.</span></p> <h2><strong>10. Afleet Alex (2005 Preakness winner)</strong></h2> <p>"Afleet" doesn''t mean anything. It''s not an actual word. But when you see "Afleet Alex" you think, "This is a quick horse. This is a physically light horse. This is a horse that is fleet on his feet. This is a horse that runs very fast."</p> <p><img src="http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5196893becad04d869000002-620-496-620-/afleet-alex-horse.jpg" border="0" alt="afleet alex horse" width="620" /></p> <h2><strong>9. Clyde Van Dusen (1929 Kentucky Derby winner)&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Clyde Van Dusen is named after his jockey and trainer, Clyde Van Dusen. Naming your horse after yourself (first and last name) is the ultimate power move. It is Clyde Van Dusen signaling to the world that the horse is not a wild animal, but an extension of himself.</p> <p><img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/51968afeecad04356e000000-760-380/clyde-van-dusen-1.jpg" border="0" alt="clyde van dusen" width="620" /></p> <h2><strong>8. Seattle Slew (1977 Triple Crown winner)</strong></h2> <p>Silky-smooth name. Manages to connote something agrarian even though it has the word "Seattle" in it.</p> <p><img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/51968e7beab8eadb4f000019-620-310/seattle-slew.jpg" border="0" alt="seattle slew" /></p> <h2><strong>7. Sly Fox (1898 Preakness winner)</strong></h2> <p>Works on two levels: 1) it tells you a little bit about the character of the horse 2) Sly could maybe be short for Sylvester, and "Sylvester Fox" would be #1 on this list.</p> <p><img src="http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5196918a69bedd134b000001-620-310/sly-fox-newspaper-article.jpg" border="0" alt="sly fox newspaper article" /></p> <h2><strong><span>6. War Admiral (1937 Triple Crown winner)</span></strong></h2> <p><span>War Admiral is a strong and important horse who will crush you, like a fleet of Navy carriers descending on a small troop of rebels who''ve been on a small island for weeks without suitable rations, their number dwindling after an outbreak of typhus, awaiting the mechanical death creeping toward them from across the sea. That''s the impression I get from the name "War Admiral."</span></p> <p><span><img src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5196944a69bedd3554000000-620-310/war-admiral-horse.jpg" border="0" alt="war admiral horse" /></span></p> <h2><strong>5. Tabasco Cat (1994 Belmont winner)</strong></h2> <p>IT''S A HORSE NAMED TABASCO CAT.</p> <p><img src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/51968f1269beddf642000007-620-460/tabasco-cat-horse.jpg" border="0" alt="tabasco cat horse" /></p> <h2><strong>4. Thunder Gulch (1995 Kentucky Derby winner)</strong></h2> <p>What an evocative name. Close your eyes and think of the words.&nbsp;<em>Thunder Gulch...&nbsp;</em>"It''s night time. You come to an open space in the woods and hear the faint trickling of a stream. Before you is a deep ravine, a gulch. There''s a horse down there. He''s alone. Your eyes meet and it becomes clear that he is the curious one. Then the sound of faraway thunder, and you both turn away."</p> <p><img src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/51968ceaeab8ead94f000006-620-451/thunder-gulch-kentucky-derby.jpg" border="0" alt="thunder gulch kentucky derby" width="620" /></p> <h2><strong>3. Whiskery (1927 Preakness Winner)</strong></h2> <p>"Whiskery" is a commentary on the inherent absurdity of horse names.&nbsp;A horse is born with what appear to be whiskers. You name him Whiskery.&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/51968f7b69beddf447000000-614-480/horse_whiskery-big.jpg" border="0" alt="Horse_Whiskery big" width="620" /></p> <h2><strong>2. Joe Cotton (1885 Kentucky Derby Winner)</strong></h2> <p>I love it when horses have people names. Joe Cotton sounds like a very cool and very handsome 28-year-old drifter who knows a thing or two about how the world works.</p> <p>Joe Cotton died in 1888 during a race. In his obituary the <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/new-york-times">New York Times</a> didn''t write that he "died," but rather than he was "destroyed" &mdash; as if he was an entity incapable of death.</p> <p><img src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/51967a846bb3f7204b000008-620-304/joe-cotton-nyt-obituary.jpg" border="0" alt="joe cotton nyt obituary" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>1. Real Quiet (1998 Kentucky Derby winner)</strong></h2> <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A beautiful, powerful name. It''s about the thing that comes right after a hush of quiet &mdash; the break in the silence &mdash; a great horse bursting through the gates.</span></p> <p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><img src="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/519670316bb3f74437000014-900-591/real-quiet-1998-kentucky%20derby.jpg" border="0" alt="real quiet 1998 kentucky derby" width="620" /><br /></span></p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sportspage">Sports Page</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/BISportsPage">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c126d6d/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5&t=The+10+Best+Horse+Names+Of+All+Time" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5&t=The+10+Best+Horse+Names+Of+All+Time" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5&t=The+10+Best+Horse+Names+Of+All+Time" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5&t=The+10+Best+Horse+Names+Of+All+Time" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5&t=The+10+Best+Horse+Names+Of+All+Time" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165665141681/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c126d6d/kg/342-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165665141681/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c126d6d/kg/342-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165665141681/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c126d6d/kg/342-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZigP2haKxEo:ELKSa1CxVDk:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ZigP2haKxEo" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-17 08:45:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/10-best-horse-names-of-all-time-2013-5', '2013-05-18 11:16:26');

So far, Bloomberg has hired a top editor to come up with rules on how reporters can use terminal data, hired a law firm to investigate, appointed a compliance officer and now, asked Palmisano to conduct a review.</p> <p>There''s even some talk that Goldman might create its own <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-mulls-making-own-bloomberg-chat-2013-5">Bloomberg-like terminal chat system.</a></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/enterprise-tech-rock-stars-2013-5" >15 Enterprise Tech Rock Stars You''ve Never Heard Of But Should Know</a></strong></p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/enterprise">SAI: Enterprise</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/bi_enterprise">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c17df5e/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5&t=Bloomberg+Gets+IBM+Ex-CEO+Sam+Palmisano+To+Investigate+Its+Terminal+Scandal" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5&t=Bloomberg+Gets+IBM+Ex-CEO+Sam+Palmisano+To+Investigate+Its+Terminal+Scandal" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5&t=Bloomberg+Gets+IBM+Ex-CEO+Sam+Palmisano+To+Investigate+Its+Terminal+Scandal" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5&t=Bloomberg+Gets+IBM+Ex-CEO+Sam+Palmisano+To+Investigate+Its+Terminal+Scandal" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5&t=Bloomberg+Gets+IBM+Ex-CEO+Sam+Palmisano+To+Investigate+Its+Terminal+Scandal" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664091894/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c17df5e/kg/342-355-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664091894/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c17df5e/kg/342-355-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165664091894/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c17df5e/kg/342-355-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=VU8GtZXZYmM:X8JHYPO22t0:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/VU8GtZXZYmM" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-18 12:59:04', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-gets-ibm-ex-ceo-sam-palmisano-to-investigate-its-terminal-scandal-2013-5', '2013-05-18 13:28:18'),

href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/sheryl-sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> said in an interview published Saturday says it''s ok for women to cry at work, share emotions and be honest about their femininity.</p> <p>Sandberg shot to global fame after her the publication of her best-selling book "Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead" which talks about women''s career struggles and advises women to "lean in" to reach their potential.</p> <p>It has drawn bouquets from admirers for articulating a new modern feminist vision and brickbats from critics who say her lofty position has made her out-of-touch with the gruelling personal cost of combining career and family.</p> <p>In an interview with India''s Mint business daily, the 43-year-old admitted: "I cry at work," adding women are not "one type of person Monday through Friday" and "then a different person in the nights and weekend."</p> <p>"I think we are all of us emotional beings and it''s okay for us to share that emotion at work," said Facebook''s number two, who was named in Time magazine''s 2013 list as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.</p> <p>Studies have shown women are more prone than men to cry at work because males are schooled not to cry in public and it can hurt their career progression.</p> <p>Sandberg, who is married with two young children, said on the subject of her book "the messages of believing in yourself and sitting at the table, getting compensated fairly, those can happen at any point in your career."</p> <p>It is necessary to talk about gender-related issues honestly in the workplace, and a need for employers to say: "I am here to support you", she added in the interview.</p> <p>The question of whether women can "have it all" in terms of pursuing careers and raising families is "very problematic", added Sandberg, who got $26.2 million in salary, bonus and shares last year from the US social networking giant.</p> <p>Men never face such questions because society assumes they can have both professions and children, she said in the interview.</p> <p>A huge percentage of women globally have both children and work full-time, but to do so they must get the "support they need at the workplace and at home," Sandberg said.</p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/warroom">War Room</a> on <a

With every new product update, every new feature, every new virtual service, it became more and more clear that Google isn''t just a search company that makes loads of cash by showing you ads. It''s creeping into every aspect of our digital, physical, and private lives at an exponential rate.&nbsp;</p> <p>I''m still trying to wrap my mind around it.</p> <p>Google isn''t just the backbone of the Internet anymore. It''s rapidly becoming the backbone of your entire life, all thanks to data you''re voluntarily giving up to a private company based on your Web searches, photos, <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/gmail">Gmail</a> messages, and more.</p> <p>After spending three days at I/O this week, it became more apparent than ever that unless millions (billions?) of people suddenly change their mind and start using alternative tech tools, or unless the government steps in waving the anti-trust banner, our lives, our history, and our personal wealth could be managed by one company &ndash;&ndash; Google.</p> <p>It''s the most apparent in Google Now, a voice-powered personal assistant that launched on Android phones last year. At I/O, it became even more clear that Google no longer sees search as returning a list of 10 or 20 relevant links when you type in a query. Google Now is much more than that. It''s the embodiment of that geeky dream of a "Star Trek Computer," an intelligent machine that understands natural language and real-world context to assist you before you even know you need assistance.&nbsp;</p> <p>Google Now scans your email and knows when your <a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/amazoncom">Amazon</a> package is arriving. It knows what sports scores to show you based on the teams you''ve searched for. It knows what stock prices to show you based on the companies you search for. It scans your calendar and reminds you when to leave to make your appointment on time. And all that data is delivered to you without you having to ask.&nbsp;</p> <p>Following I/O, Google Now is more prevalent than before. Google recently launched the app on iPhones and iPads, and it''s coming to the desktop soon if you use the Chrome Web browser. Next year, you''ll be wearing Google Now on your face if you buy Google Glass.</p> <p>Then there are photos, arguably the most personal things you share online. Now, Google scans every single one you upload to Google+. It can learn what your family members look like and group photos of them into albums automatically. It can tell if your subjects are smiling. If they''re not smiling, it can stitch their faces in from other images where they are and create the perfect photo for you. It knows if you''re taking pictures of mountains or puppies or buildings or famous landmarks and group your photo albums together accordingly.</p> <p>It''s creepy and magical at the same time.</p> <p><span>Google Glass didn''t get any stage time during the I/O keynote, but it was still a significant part of the event.

Someone shot him in the 5400 block of West Wrightwood Avenue about 9 p.m., Greer said. The boy was walking with a few other people in the Cragin neighborhood when someone approached on foot and shot him.</p> <p>In addition to those shootings, two 18-year-old men were shot in the Englewood neighborhood, police said.</p> <p>The shootings happened on the 5800 block of South Laflin Street at 10:20 p.m., according to Police news affairs officer Hector Alfaro. One of the men sustained a gunshot wound to his left calf and the other was shot in the hip, Alfaro said. Both were taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, where their conditions had stabilized.</p> <p>At about 10:50 p.m., a 34-year-old man was shot on the 12000 block of South Perry in the West Pullman neighborhood on the Far South Side, police said. The man was standing outside when a light-colored SUV drove up and shot the man in the back and abdomen, police said. The man was taken in critical condition to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, police said.</p> <p>Then in the Lawndale neighborhood three people were shot on the 1200 block of South Kolin Avenue, police said. The shooting happened at 11:25 p.m., police said. No other details were immediately available.</p> <p>Police found three guns near a garbage can in an alley near the crime scene: two described by police as Tec-9 or similar-styled handguns and one AK-47-styled gun with wood components.</p> <p>Residents nearby described the gunfire as rapid and loud.</p> <p>A 38-year-old man, 38-year-old woman and 27-year-old woman were shot outside. A van, still running, sat in the alley west of Kolin Avenue and south of Roosevelt Road.</p> <p>About 3:35 a.m., a 20-year-old man showed up at Mount Sinai Hospital with a gunshot wound to his left shoulder. Greer said he was a passenger in a car near Division Street and Pulaski Road when another car pulled up and its occupants threw gang signs and shouted gang slogans before someone fired at the 20-year-old. He''s in stable condition at the hospital.</p> <p>Check back for more information.</p> <p>chicagobreaking@tribune.com</p> <p>Twitter: @ChicagoBreaking ___</p> <div class="nc_footer"> <p>(c)2013 the Chicago Tribune</p> <p>Visit the Chicago Tribune at <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com">www.chicagotribune.com</a></p> <p>Distributed by MCT Information Services</p> </div> <p><img class="nc_pixel" src="http://pixel.newscred.com/px.gif?key=YXJ0aWNsZT0yN2E1N2Q0NTg1ZmMyMDViNTg4OTUzYTAyZTE4YjIxMSZvd25lcj0zNDQ5NjhiY2NjN2VmZjJhNDYzYTk2ZjA3YzVmYTQ2NSZub25jZT02ZjdhZWI1Ni1mZmRkLTRjMDktYTY0MS0zNzM3OTllN2ExYzAmcHVibGlzaGVyPThjMDBmYmVlNjFkNWJjZjBjNjA5MmQ4YjkyZWJiY2Ex" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/law">Law &amp; Order</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/bi_lawandorder">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c171f7e/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5&t=Chicago+Gun+Violence+Claims+11+More+Victims+Overnight" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5&t=Chicago+Gun+Violence+Claims+11+More+Victims+Overnight" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5&t=Chicago+Gun+Violence+Claims+11+More+Victims+Overnight" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5&t=Chicago+Gun+Violence+Claims+11+More+Victims+Overnight" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2F11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5&t=Chicago+Gun+Violence+Claims+11+More+Victims+Overnight" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664090134/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c171f7e/kg/342-358-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664090134/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c171f7e/kg/342-358-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165664090134/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c171f7e/kg/342-358-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=9HfV4uUQwGs:ZQb_ZOz2_bY:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/9HfV4uUQwGs" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-18 11:24:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/11-shootings-in-chicago-overnight-18-2013-5', '2013-05-18 13:28:18');

The WLI annualized growth indicator (WLIg) dropped to 7.0% from 7.4% last week, an upward revision from 7.3%.</p> <p>Last year ECRI switched focus to their version of the <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Big-Four-Economic-Indicators.php" target="_blank">Big Four Economic Indicators</a> that I routinely track. But when those failed last summer to "roll over" collectively (as ECRI claimed was happening), the company published a new set of indicators to support their recession call in a commentary entitled <a href="http://ecri-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/ECRI_1303_US_Business_Cycle.pdf" target="_blank">The U.S. Business Cycle in the Context of the Yo-Yo Years</a> (<a class="hidden_link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/pdf">PDF</a> format). Late last month the company added its most recent publically available commentary on their website: <a href="http://www.businesscycle.com/ecri-news-events/news-details/economic-cycle-research-nominal-gdp-growth-falls-again" target="_blank">Nominal GDP Growth Falls Again</a>.</p> <p>Essentially ECRI is sticking to its call that a recession began in mid-2012, although the company calls it a "mild" recession, which is quite a shift from their original stance 19 months ago: "<em>...if you think this is a bad economy, you haven''t seen anything yet."</em></p> <p>ECRI posts its proprietary indicators on a one-week delayed basis to the general public, but last year the company switched its focus to a version of the <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Big-Four-Economic-Indicators.php" target="_blank">Big Four Economic Indicators</a> I''ve been tracking for the past year. In recent months, however, those indicators have slipped below the fold, replaced by the mixed bag of whatever <em>Indicator du Jour</em> might look recessionary, as in the "Yo-Yo Years" commentary linked above. Likewise, see this March 7th <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-recession-began-middle-of-2012-achuthan-says-w1RsvrcETIGv%7Ep1LSvwIIg.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg video</a>. At about the 2-minute point Achuthan reasserts his call that a recession began in the middle of 2012. In previous interviews he has specifically mentioned July as the business cycle peak, thus putting us in the tenth month of a recession.</p> <p>Here is a chart of ECRI''s data that illustrates why the company''s published proprietary indicator has little credibility as a recession indicator. It''s the smoothed year-over-year percent change since 2000 of their weekly leading index. I''ve highlighted the 2011 date of ECRI''s recession call and the hypothetical July business cycle peak, which the company claims was the start of a recession.</p> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p> <div align="center"><a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/index.html?indicators/ECRI-WLI-YoY-since-2000.gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/indicators/ECRI-WLI-YoY-since-2000.gif?maxX=640" border="1" alt="Click to View" title="Click to View" width="640" /></a><br /> <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/index.html?indicators/ECRI-WLI-YoY-since-2000.gif" target="_blank">Click for a larger image</a></div> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p> <p>Here are two significant developments since ECRI''s publick recession call on September 30, 2011:</p> <blockquote><ol> <li>The S&amp;P 500 is up 45.9%.</li> <li>The unemployment rate has dropped from 9.0% to 7.5%.</li> </ol></blockquote> <p>Ultimately my opinion remains unchanged: The ECRI''s credibility depends on major downward revisions to the key economic indicators -- especially the July annual revisions to GDP -- that will be sufficient to validate their early recession call. Of course, the July revisions will be quite controversial this year, with some major accounting changes and revisions in annual GDP back to 1929 (more <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/04/26/gdp-gets-bigger-not-necessarily-faster/" target="_blank">here</a>). So if we don''t get the downward revisions to support ECRI, they can always question the accounting changes in the revision process.</p> <p><strong>A Closer Look at ECRI''s Latest Recession Evidence</strong></p> <p>Their latest recession evidence is the YoY growth in nominal GDP, which they highlight in this chart.</p> <div class="center"><img src="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/2013/ECRI-Nominal-GDP-YoY.gif" border="0" alt="" /></div> <p>ECRI is absolutely correct in their observation that "yoy nominal GDP growth at or below 3.7% has been seen only in recessionary contexts. In Q1 2013, it fell to 3.4%, the second straight quarter below 3.7%."</p> <p>For further support of their point, here is a snapshot of YoY Nominal GDP as far back as quarterly GDP has been calculated by the Commerce Department.</p> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p> <div align="center"><a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/index.html?indicators/GDP-YoY-nominal.gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/indicators/GDP-YoY-nominal.gif" border="1" alt="Click to View" title="Click to View" width="640" /></a><br /> <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/index.html?indicators/GDP-YoY-nominal.gif" target="_blank">Click for a larger image</a></div> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p> <p>However, some might argue that the use of nominal GDP for a YoY analysis is problematic, especially to those of us who had 12% mortgages during that era of stagflation against the backdrop of a Fed Funds rate in the upper teens. Doesn''t YoY real GDP have more credibility? Not surprisingly ECRI doesn''t chart the the real YoY series, which has a couple of recessions that started with a lower YoY number than the latest data point.</p> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p> <div align="center"><a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/index.html?indicators/GDP-YoY-real.gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/indicators/GDP-YoY-real.gif" border="1" alt="Click to View" title="Click to View" width="640" /></a><br /> <a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/index.html?indicators/GDP-YoY-real.gif" target="_blank">Click for a larger image</a></div> <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p> <p>Actually, I think we could make a strong case for preferring the YoY behavior of real GDP per capita.

This indicator would definitely not be of interest to ECRI.</p> <p><strong>ECRI''s Recession Call Was a Bet Against the Fed</strong></p> <p>Let''s briefly review the history of the ECRI recession call. ECRI adamantly denied that the sharp decline of their indicators in 2010 marked the beginning of a recession. But in 2011, when their proprietary indicators were at levels higher than 2010, they made their controversial recession call with stunning confidence bordering on arrogance:</p> <div class="center"> <table style="width: 95%;" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#e6e6e6"> <tbody> <tr> <td>Early last week [September 21, 2011], ECRI notified clients that the U.S. economy is indeed tipping into a new recession. And there''s nothing that policy makers can do to head it off.... <br /><br /> Here''s what ECRI''s recession call really says: if you think this is a bad economy, you haven''t seen anything yet. And that has profound implications for both Main Street and Wall Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.businesscycle.com/reports_indexes/reportsummarydetails/1091" target="_blank">source</a>)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>Ironically enough, on the same day ECRI forecast a recession, Chairman Bernanke announced a new policy, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110921a.htm" target="_blank">Operation Twist</a>, which was followed by QE3 in September 2012 and unlimited easing (aka QE4) in December 2012.</p> <p>Essentially ECRI claim that <em>"there''s nothing that policy makers can do to head it [a recession] off"</em> was a bet against the Fed.</p> <p>For a few months after ECRI''s recession call, their proprietary indicators cooperated with their forecast, but that has not been the case since the second half of 2012 -- hence their switch to the traditional Big Four recession indicators. Now that those are less cooperative, ECRI is cherry picking other indicators and switching to year-over-year perspectives when the monthly trend isn''t sloping downward.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For alternatives to ECRI''s recession forecasting, see method developed by Anton and Georg Vrba:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/guest/Vrba-130422-iM-Weekly-Business-Cycle.php" target="_blank" class="MoreLink">iM''s Weekly Business Cycle Index</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>See also Dwaine Van Vuuren''s latest RecessionALERT indicator snapshot:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><a href="http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/guest/Dwaine-van-Vuuren-130411-WLI-Update.php" target="_blank" class="MoreLink">RecessionALERT Weekly Leading Index Update</a></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr size="1" /> <div class="center"> <h3>Appendix: A Closer Look at the ECRI Index</h3> </div> <p>Despite the increasing irrelevance of the ECRI''s recession indicators in recent years, let''s check them out.

Our current level is 11.9% off the most recent high, which was set over five years ago in June 2007. We''re now tied with the previously longest stretch between highs, which was from February 1973 to April 1978. But the index level rose steadily from the trough at the end of the 1973-1975 recession to reach its new high in 1978. The pattern in ECRI''s indictor is quite different, and this has no doubt been a key factor in their business cycle analysis.</p> <p><strong>The WLIg Metric</strong></p> <p>The best known of ECRI''s indexes is their growth calculation on the WLI.

Here is an excerpt from the announcement:</p> <div align="center"> <table style="width: 95%;" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#e6e6e6"> <tbody> <tr> <td>Early last week, ECRI notified clients that the U.S. economy is indeed tipping into a new recession. And there''s nothing that policy makers can do to head it off. <br /><br /> ECRI''s recession call isn''t based on just one or two leading indexes, but on dozens of specialized leading indexes, including the U.S. Long Leading Index, which was the first to turn down &mdash; before the Arab Spring and Japanese earthquake &mdash; to be followed by downturns in the Weekly Leading Index and other shorter-leading indexes. In fact, the most reliable forward-looking indicators are now collectively behaving as they did on the cusp of full-blown recessions, not "soft landings."

My primary interest was the then-new electrification of the (?? / ??) T&aacute;ib?i - (??) G?oxi&oacute;ng railway. Timetable information was scarce, but it appeared that I could circle the island and visit the Alishan Forestry Railway "over the weekend," as we say.</span></p> <div id="yui_3_7_3_3_1368803155722_585" class="vsDetails"> <div id="yui_3_7_3_3_1368803155722_584" class="vsDetails"> <div id="yui_3_7_3_3_1368803155722_583" class="vsDescription"><br />According to my notes ...<br /><br />I traveled by train from T&aacute;ib?i to (?? / ??) T&aacute;in&aacute;n on 1980 July 18 (Friday). I continued to G?oxi&oacute;ng that evening.<br /><br />I traveled by overnight bus from G?oxi&oacute;ng to (?? / ??) T&aacute;id?ng, arriving early on 1980 July 19 (Saturday). I continued by train to (?? / ??) Hu?li&aacute;n, then to T&aacute;ib?i.<br /><br />(Part of the (??? / ???, B?ih&uacute;i xi&agrave;n) North Link Line was new. It was opened in 1980 February.)&nbsp;<br /><br />I had circled the island...<br /><br />On Saturday evening, 1980 June 19, I again departed T&aacute;ib?i by train. I arrived at (?? / ??) Ji?y&igrave; on Sunday morning, 1980 June 20. I traveled by train to ??? ?l?sh?n and back, then returned to T&aacute;ib?i. I departed for Seoul, Korea, on Monday, 1980 July 21.<br /><br />Most of the railway system in Taiwan was built during the period of Japanese rule. There were many traces of this. Some were technical, such as the track gauge (1,067mm). Others were aesthetic, such as station architecture. Still others were cultural (!). I was very surprised to hear people referring to boxed meals, sold at railway stations and aboard trains, as "bento" (!!).<br /><br />A man I met on the Alishan railway said, about the railway staff, "They are speaking Japanese" (!!!). (This I consider unlikely ...)&nbsp;<br /><br />The T&aacute;ib?i - G?oxi&oacute;ng railway electrification was carried out as part of a group of infrastructure projects called (???? /????), Sh&iacute;d&agrave;ji&agrave;nsh&egrave;", "Ten Major Construction Projects."<br /><br />The "Ten Major Construction Projects" also included the T&aacute;ib?i - G?oxi&oacute;ng express highway: (??????), Zh?ngsh?n g?os&ugrave; g?ngl&ugrave;, "Sun Yat-sen Expressway.") This was opened in stages during 1974-1978, and provided strong competition for the railway. Electrification permitted travel time reductions and strengthened the railway''s competitive position.&nbsp;<br /><br />Steam traction moved a significant share of railway traffic in Taiwan through the end of the 1970s. The British magazine "Continental Railway Journal" (CRJ) - which I did not know about "back then" - published several reports.<br /><br />At early 1977, about 25 percent of local passengers, and about 33 percent of all goods, were moved by steam locomotives. These were concentrated on the Western Line (???? / ????, X?b&ugrave; G&agrave;nxi&agrave;n).<br /><br />The CRJ report stated that very little use of steam traction had been observed on the Y&iacute;l&aacute;n xi&agrave;n (??? / ???, ) T&aacute;ib?i - (?? / ??) S?&agrave;o, or the P&iacute;ngd?ng Line (??? / ???, P&iacute;ngd?ng xi&agrave;n), G?oxi&oacute;ng - P&iacute;ngd?ng.<br /><br />A subsequent CRJ report stated that, at 1979 January, use of steam traction declined rapidly as use of electric traction expanded. The end of steam was forecast officially for 1979 August. (This goal was not met.)<br /><br />According to CRJ, visiting railway enthusiasts did not experience difficulty because of photography - except at "steam sheds" (locomotive maintenance facilities). At early 1977, all steam sheds were open to visitors - except the one at Ji?y&igrave;. A subsequent CRJ report stated that, at 1978, steam sheds were off limits to visitors, and adjacent storage tracks were off limits to visitors. According to this report, the steam shed at Ji?y&igrave; had a sign, in English (!), which read: "No admittance. No photographs."<br />&nbsp;</div> </div> </div><h3>Today, Taiwan is a world beater in every category of development, with GDP per capita rivaling Germany''s.</h3> <img src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/51963acb69bedd706d000009-400-300/today-taiwan-is-a-world-beater-in-every-category-of-development-with-gdp-per-capita-rivaling-germanys.jpg" alt="" /> <p><p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita#cite_note-4">IMF</a></p></p> <br/><br/><h3>It has its own stock exchange.</h3> <img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/51963c2769bedde46d00000e-400-300/it-has-its-own-stock-exchange.jpg" alt="" /> <br/><br/><h3>It hosts international fashion shows.</h3> <img src="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/51963e826bb3f75659000004-400-300/it-hosts-international-fashion-shows.jpg" alt="" /> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/incredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5#and-runs-a-world-renowned-film-festival-4">See the rest of the story at Business Insider</a> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/moneygame">Money Game</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/themoneygame">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c1063a5/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fincredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5&t=Take+A+Tour+Of+Taiwan+Before+Its+Economy+Went+Boom" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fincredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5&t=Take+A+Tour+Of+Taiwan+Before+Its+Economy+Went+Boom" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fincredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5&t=Take+A+Tour+Of+Taiwan+Before+Its+Economy+Went+Boom" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fincredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5&t=Take+A+Tour+Of+Taiwan+Before+Its+Economy+Went+Boom" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fincredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5&t=Take+A+Tour+Of+Taiwan+Before+Its+Economy+Went+Boom" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165665136425/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c1063a5/kg/342-355-363-367/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165665136425/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c1063a5/kg/342-355-363-367/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165665136425/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c1063a5/kg/342-355-363-367/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=xQVJclcrMvc:O40aVj1lm2Q:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/xQVJclcrMvc" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-18 10:08:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/incredible-photos-from-pre-boom-taiwan-2013-5', '2013-05-18 13:28:18'),
(149, 4, 'The Economy Continues To Send A Ton Of Bearish Signals', 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/businessinsider/~3/0ndDHeRqW4g/bearish-on-stocks-2013-5', '<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img class="float_right" src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5155b147eab8ead24c000003-494-370-400-/sad-brown-grizzly-bear-1.png" border="0" alt="sad brown grizzly bear" width="400" />It has long been our underlying thesis that the huge amount of household debt accumulated during the housing boom would inhibit consumer spending and economic growth for some time to come, and this is what has been happening over the last few years. The errors recently found in the famous Rogoff-Reinhart (RR) book do not change this view.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Simply put, household debt averaged 77% of disposable personal income (DPI) over the 61-year period since 1952. It crossed over the average line in 1985 and took a sharp upward turn in 2000, eventually peaking at 130% of DPI in 2007. Since that time, consumers have reduced their debt to a level that is now 105% of DPI, still significantly higher than in the past. The result has been a significant slowdown and tepid recovery in consumer spending growth, a process that is far from finished.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The role of household savings is a key element in analyzing both debt and spending. For 41 years between 1951 and 1992 household savings rates as a percent of disposable income were consistently between 7% and 11%. However, as income growth started to slow down, consumers increasingly maintained their old spending habits by going into more debt and reducing their savings rate. This reached an extreme during the prior decade, when the savings rate stayed below 2% from 2005 through 2007, while debt soared. We all know how that ended.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">No matter what you hear from the politicians, the media and &ldquo;the street&rdquo;, keep in mind that the combination of the household debt, low savings rates and tepid increases in income has been the reason for the deep recession and subsequent below average growth, and will continue to be the reason why economic growth will likely be slow for some time to come.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the last two years, between the 1st quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2013, real consumer spending has increased by a meager 3.8%----and this was accomplished on an increase of only 1.1% in real disposable income as households reduced their saving rate from 5.1% to 2.6%. It therefore should not have been a surprise that spending looked so weak in March, and it should be no surprise when spending remains subdued in the period ahead. With consumer spending accounting for about 70% of GDP, it is easy to see why this puts a damper on the rest of the economy, particularly in a time of fiscal drag. The Fed is undoubtedly well aware of the outlook as they continue their attempt to try and offset, at least in part, the major headwinds elsewhere in the economy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">None of the above analysis depends on the Rogoff-Reinhart (RR) research, some of which was recently found to be erroneous. First, RR emphasizes mostly government rather than consumer debt. Second, they maintain that when the government debt-to-GDP ratio crosses 90%, economic growth slows down. The idea that there was some specific threshold of government debt-to-GDP that led to slower growth was probably not valid in the first place. In any event, we think that for the near-to-intermediate term, it is the still-high level of household debt that is the key drag on the economy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As we headed into the spring there was evidence that the already lackluster economy was slowing down even further.&nbsp; Although the payroll employment report for April touched off a euphoric rise in stocks, the headline belied the underlying trend. While that was a positive surprise over the expected rise of 140,000 jobs, the reported increase of 165,000 for the month was nothing to write home about. It was well below the 1st quarter average of 206,000 per month as well as the 4th quarter average of 209,000. If anything, it looks as if employment increases are decelerating, certainly not a reason for celebration.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In addition to the mediocre employment report there was a lot of other evidence that an already lackluster economy was slowing down further as we headed into the spring. The ISM manufacturing index fell for two consecutive months to its lowest level since December. The ISM non-manufacturing index also declined for two straight months and is now below its 1st quarter average. April vehicle sales slipped to under 15 million units for the first time since October. First quarter GDP grew at a disappointing 2.5% following only 0.3% in the prior quarter. Average GDP growth for the last four quarters has averaged only 1.8%. Real consumer spending has increased only 2% over the past year, and this was accomplished on an exceedingly weak 0.9% rise in real disposable income over the period. Only a sharp drop in the savings rate enabled consumers to reach even that disappointing level. </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, March core capital goods orders were up only 0.2% following a 4.8% decline in February. The year-over-year gain was 0.3%. The NAHB housing market index for May increased for the first time in four months and remains below the December/January peak. April housing starts dropped to the lowest level since November.&nbsp; Although the NFIB Small Business Index rose in April, it is only five points above its lowest level for the past year and two points lower than a year earlier.&nbsp; The index remains lower than at any point prior to 2008. Manufacturing production has declined for the last two months and three of the last four.&nbsp; The Philadelphia Fed survey fell to minus 5.2, its lowest since February, and showed negative results for new orders, shipments and employment. All in all, despite the optimistic views of the economic pundits, the facts show otherwise.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As for foreign economies, the IMF once again reduced its 2013 global and EU growth forecasts and China reported disappointing results for 1st quarter GDP and exports. This has resulted in a significant drop in commodity prices that is having adverse effects on a number of commodity-oriented emerging and advanced economies.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although the Fed, so far, has been able to lift stock prices, it has failed to elevate the economy to a point where growth is self-sustaining despite over four years of extremely easy monetary policy. The headwinds from fiscal policy will actually intensify in the months ahead while Washington shows few signs of alleviating the dysfunction that has plagued Congress for the last few years.&nbsp; </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is also noteworthy that the market is losing the important boost it has received from rapidly rising earnings.&nbsp; Over the last four quarters earnings are up only 0.4% from the four prior quarters.&nbsp; Given sluggish U.S. and global economic growth, we think that current estimates of 22% second half earnings growth are highly unrealistic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the S&amp;P 500 is now selling at 20 times cyclically-smoothed trailing GAAP earnings, at the very high end of the zone that was considered normal prior to the serial bubbles of the last decade and a half.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">All in all, we believe that economic growth and corporate earnings will be highly disappointing in coming quarters and that investors will drop the pretense that the Fed can fix everything that ails the economy. Although Bernanke, himself, has been virtually begging for help from fiscal policy, it does not seem likely that he will get it anytime soon.&nbsp; In our view, the risk of a substantial decline in the market outweighs the limited rewards from current levels.</span></p> <p><p>Please follow <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/moneygame">Money Game</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/themoneygame">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/businessinsider">Facebook</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bearish-on-stocks-2013-5#comments">Join the conversation about this story &#187;</a></p><img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''http://businessinsider.com.feedsportal.com/c/34800/f/641403/s/2c167525/mf.gif'' border=''0''/><div class=''mf-viral''><table border=''0''><tr><td valign=''middle''><a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbearish-on-stocks-2013-5&t=The+Economy+Continues+To+Send+A+Ton+Of+Bearish+Signals" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbearish-on-stocks-2013-5&t=The+Economy+Continues+To+Send+A+Ton+Of+Bearish+Signals" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbearish-on-stocks-2013-5&t=The+Economy+Continues+To+Send+A+Ton+Of+Bearish+Signals" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbearish-on-stocks-2013-5&t=The+Economy+Continues+To+Send+A+Ton+Of+Bearish+Signals" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbearish-on-stocks-2013-5&t=The+Economy+Continues+To+Send+A+Ton+Of+Bearish+Signals" target="_blank"><img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664088789/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c167525/kg/342-363/a2.htm"><img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165664088789/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c167525/kg/342-363/a2.img" border="0"/></a><img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165664088789/u/49/f/641403/c/34800/s/2c167525/kg/342-363/a2t.img" border="0"/><div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:F7zBnMyn0Lo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:F7zBnMyn0Lo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:V_sGLiPBpWU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:V_sGLiPBpWU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=0ndDHeRqW4g:XGntwlsDRPE:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/0ndDHeRqW4g" height="1" width="1"/>', '', '', '2013-05-18 09:59:00', '', '', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/bearish-on-stocks-2013-5', '2013-05-18 13:28:18'),

(158, 6, 'The Best Twitter Client for Android', 'http://lifehacker.com/5810139/the-best-twitter-client-for-android', '<p class="has-media media-640"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitAllowFullScreen="webkitAllowFullScreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" class="youtube" height="360" width="640" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tTNIrAakMb8?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0" id="youtube-tTNIrAakMb8"></iframe></span></p>\n<p class="first-text">The sheer number of Twitter clients available for Android is staggering, but few of them are actually worth considering. Times have changed, and the best Twitter app for Android has changed along with it. We think that Falcon Pro deserves the nod, and is well worth your money if you use Twitter with any regularity.</p>\n<p><em>Update: Our previous pick for the App Directory was <a href="http://twicca.r246.jp/" target="_blank">Twicca</a>, and before that Twidroyd (now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twidroid" target="_blank">UberSocial</a>), so if the comments below look a little out of place, it''s because we''ve updated our pick as time has passed to reflect what we think is the best Twitter app for Android.</em></p>\n\n<h3><a href="http://getfalcon.pro/" target="_blank">Falcon Pro</a></h3>\n<p>Platform: Android<br/> Price: $2<br/> <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon.pro&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Download Page</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul><li>View your feed, mentions, direct messages, retweets, favorites, lists, and user profiles, all in a gesture-based sliding interface that keeps your stream front and center.</li><li>Supports Twitter lists and favorites natively. Also allows you to star individual users so you can read their streams without following them or adding them to lists.</li><li>Search for tweets, users, hashtags, and trending topics, and save those searches for future reference.</li><li>Supports native retweets, &quot;quote&quot; retweets, and &quot;via&quot; retweets so you can comment before posting.</li><li>Supports offline favoriting, so you can still read favorites without a connection.</li><li>Saves half-composed tweets as drafts so you can finish them later.</li><li>Swipe left-to-right to reveal links to your mentions, DMs, retweets, favorites, settings, and more. Swipe right-to-left to open the right side of the screen, with your Twitter lists, saved searches, and starred users, all quickly accessible.</li><li>Features a built-in browser, so tapping an article URL will load a lightweight version of the article (sans ads and clutter) in a viewer below the tweet—this way you can read the article without leaving Falcon Pro. If you dislike the &quot;mobile view&quot; in the browser, you can disable it to force the full version of the page to load. The built-in browser also supports Google Play app descriptions, streaming video, and photos. The photos are even zoomable, so you can pinch-to-zoom to get a better view.</li><li>Offers a dedicated view just for your tweets that others have retweeted, and shows you who retweeted.</li><li>Allows you to view and edit your profile (including profile photo) from within the app, browse your followers and the users you follow, and follow/unfollow/managed blocked users from inside the app.</li><li>One tap shows full conversations so you can keep up with tweets between users you follow.</li><li>Supports light and dark themes, gives you customization options over link color, font size, and more.</li><li>Allows you to mute users so their tweets won''t appear in your feed without unfollowing them.</li><li>Allows you to view specific users from your home feed, including their profile and recent tweets.</li><li>Supports sharing tweets, URLs, and images from inside the app, without forcing you to open a browser or image viewer to do so.</li><li>Built-in URL shortening (and expansion), photo posting, and video posting from a number of different services.</li><li>Works in portrait and landscape mode.</li><li>Supports Android phones and tablets, in one universal app.</li><li>Features a fully customizable home screen widget, complete with transparency, background, color, and text options.</li><li>Supports <a href="http://lifehacker.com/supercharge-your-lock-screen-with-dashclock-and-these-a-493206006">Dashclock Widget</a><inset id="493206006"></inset> natively.</li><li>Direct sharing from other apps like the gallery, camera, and your browser.</li><li>Geolocation support.</li><li>Customizable notifications for tweets, mentions, and direct messages, supports individual refresh rates for your timeline, mentions, and DMs.</li><li>Supports hardware acceleration for faster performance.</li><li>Can be told to only load content over Wi-Fi, if bandwidth is an issue.</li></ul>\n<h3>Where It Excels</h3>\n<p>The real beauty of Falcon Pro is that it''s one of those Twitter clients that keeps your focus right where it''s important: on your stream, your mentions, and your DMs. Beneath an elegant interface is a ton of power and a wealth of features that let you customize your reading experience just the way you like it. Whatever your specific needs are, it''s likely that Falcon Pro can be tweaked to match: whether you want the font size to be just a little larger, or you want to be notified of mentions but not DMs, or you want the app to check for new DMs more frequently than mentions, or you need a home screen widget that''s transparent, or there''s something else.</p>\n<p>The UI may be slim, but it''s super-fast, gesture-powered, and a quick swipe to either side will reveal all the options you need. Like our previous favorite, Twicca, the UI does a great job of being readable without cluttering itself up with buttons and options right on the main screen. Long-press a tweet to see more options, including quick buttons to favorite, retweet, or reply, and a menu button that leads to more choices (like deleting the tweet, muting/reporting/blocking the user, copying the tweet to your clipboard, or even translating the tweet into a different language).</p>\n<p>The built-in browser is another of Falcon Pro''s greatest features. Once you get used to viewing links in the browser without having to load your phone''s primary web browser, you''ll never go back to just tapping a link and waiting for it to open in Chrome or Dolphin or another app. Since the in-app browser supports videos and photos, they''re just a single tap away as well, and you don''t have to wait for a handoff between apps to enjoy what your friends have posted. Falcon Pro also supports Android tablets natively (without having to pay for a second, separate app), and it looks really good on them too.</p>\n<p>Falcon Pro''s customization options deserve praise as well. It''s not unusual for a Twitter client to let you tweak the text size and the font, but Falcon Pro''s settings and options are easy to use and easy to find again, and aren''t buried in a myriad of confusingly named settings. It may cost money, but it''s a far better Twitter client than the official one, and definitely the best we''ve ever seen.</p>\n<h3>Where It Falls Short</h3>\n<p>Falcon Pro is impressive, but it''s not perfect. Of course, the obvious ding on Falcon pro is the price, but that''s not really a fair ding. Sure, most other Twitter clients are free, but seriously, Falcon Pro is only $2. At the same time, Falcon Pro comes without ads, without &quot;promoted tweets&quot; or &quot;sponsored&quot; crap served up by Twitter, and you have complete control over muting and blocking anyone and any tweet from your timeline.</p>\n<p>Falcon Pro also doesn''t support multiple accounts, which is a bit of a bummer, and a more serious ding if you''re someone who has to manage a business account or you work for a brand and do their tweeting. Even if you have a blog and want to be able to check that stream on the go, you''ll need a second app installed. In fact, multi-account support is in such high demand by Falcon Pro users, it''s the most popular feature request on the app''s <a href="http://falconpro.uservoice.com/forums/186245-falcon-pro-feature-requests" target="_blank">public feature request page</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Competition</h3>\n<p>Falcon Pro is a great app, but if it doesn''t meet your needs for one reason or another, there''s are definitely alternatives.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://twicca.r246.jp/" target="_blank">Twicca</a></strong> (Free) was our previous favorite, and it''s still good. We think Falcon Pro has outpaced it, but it''s free, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5796114/twicca-is-a-fast-free-and-beautiful-twitter-client-for-android">a great Twitter app</a><inset id="5796114"></inset>, supports tons of plug-ins that extend its features, and sports an even cleaner interface. It also comes with some features that Falcon Pro doesn''t have, like the ability to color-code users and lists, and a built-in image viewer that crosses applications—I''ve raved about it before, but imagine it: You click a link to any image, whether a straight image file or an image hosted at nearly any image hosting service, and it displays right over whatever you''re doing, without loading a new app or window. When you''re done, tap back to go right back to what you''re doing. Unfortunately, Twicca only supports a single account, and its widget is a bit limited.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twitter.android" target="_blank">Twitter for Android</a></strong> (Free) is the official Twitter client, and while it''s pretty feature bare and pales in comparison to almost everything else available, at least it''s semi-regularly updated and it supports multiple accounts. It''s probably enough for most people who just read Twitter and maybe post now and again, and it''s definitely useful to have around if you have multiple accounts to manage. Still, it''s lacking some of the advanced features that the independent apps have. Plus, you never have to worry that your favorite app is suddenly unavailable because <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/02/27/falcon-pro-dev-resets-tokens-to-free-up-space-for-new-users-app-back-on-sale-at-more-reasonable-price/" target="_blank">the Twitter mothership decided to shut it down or cap its number of user access tokens</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotsandlines.carbon" target="_blank">Carbon</a></strong> (Free) is another great Twitter app that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5981722/carbon-is-a-smooth-gesture+packed-twitter-client-for-android">we''ve reviewed before</a><inset id="5981722"></inset>, and I used it for a while before I eventually moved on to Falcon Pro. The interface looks great, and it uses a host of one-handed gestures to help you easily navigate your stream, view profiles, and read your lists, mentions, and DMs. It supports in-line images, and those same gestures usually work on every screen, revealing more useful features every time. It''s Android 4.0+ only though, so if you have an older device, you''re out of luck.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.levelup.touiteur" target="_blank">Plume</a></strong> (Free, $5 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelup.touiteurpremium&amp;feature=more_from_developer" target="_blank">Premium Version</a>) is another solid option, although its users have been rebelling lately against the development path the app has taken. We still think the interface is great and the app offers a ton of filtering and customization options, and even has a similar color-coding system like Twicca does. Images are loaded in-line, and the app is snappy and fast. However, Plume it felt a little limiting by comparison, never remembered where I stopped reading, posted notifications even after exiting the app, and the app''s ads at the top of the timeline felt intrusive. Even so, it supports multiple accounts, supports tablets, has a great widget, and looks sharp.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tweetdark.wjddesigns.free" target="_blank">TweetDark</a></strong> (Free), is—stick with me here—based on TweakDeck, which <a href="https://twitter.com/tweakdeck/status/319033347361882113" target="_blank">is no longer available because of Twitter''s API upgrade</a>, which was based on TweetDeck for Android, which is also no longer available because of Twitter''s API upgrade (and because Twitter decided to discontinue it). Regardless, TweetDark does work, even if TweetDeck logins don''t work, and if you want a nice, large UI without a ton of extra features, it''s worth a look. It does, however, support Facebook, multiple Twitter accounts, and FourSquare all in the same app, so if that''s important to you, check it out. It''s lightweight, fast, and free.</p>\n<p><strong>TweetCaster</strong> (Free, $5 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handmark.tweetcaster.premium&amp;feature=related_apps" target="_blank">Premium Version</a>) takes an entirely different approach to your stream, and puts your tweets and media on tiles you can browse through and tap to enlarge. It''s a little like Google+, which isn''t a bad thing: it''s actually really good looking, especially on Android tablets, and the free version supports multiple Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts, and packs in the features. Smart lists, photo filters before sharing, customizable interface, it''s all there. It''s ad-supported, and the $5 pro version strips them out, but at least you can try all of the features for free first.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hootsuite.droid.full" target="_blank">HootSuite</a></strong> (Free) is ideal for people who use social media a lot, have multiple accounts to keep track of, or have to have Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social networks in the same app. For everyone else, it might be a little bit much, and you might not care about things like stats and analytics around your tweets and Facebook posts. Still, it''s a good Twitter app, and it''s free. In the same vein, there''s always <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seesmic" target="_blank">Seesmic</a></strong> (Free, $3 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seesmic.pro&amp;feature=more_from_developer" target="_blank">Pro Version</a>), which also supports multiple accounts and Facebook, but it''s ad-supported unless you pay for the pro version, and combined with Twitter''s own ads, that''s a little rough, especially since you''re not getting that much for the money. Plus, Seesmic is regularly upgraded, but its UI and feature-set still feel like they''ve been outpaced by faster, better Twitter apps.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em style="color: #777; font-size: 80%;">Lifehacker''s <a href="http://lifehacker.com/apps">App Directory</a> is a new and growing directory of recommendations for the best applications and tools in a number of given categories.</em></p>', '', '', '2013-05-17 01:30:00', '', 'android app directory', '5810139', '2013-05-18 18:59:53'),

In this post—which we''ll update regularly as prices and components change—we''ll walk you through the parts and hardware we''ll need for three different system builds: a budget workstation, a mid-range powerful PC, and an enthusiast''s system for gamers and media professionals.</p>\n<p>While some consider the desktop a dead platform, there are still plenty of us who use them as much as or in addition to laptops or tablets, love to play PC games, or just enjoy getting our hands dirty and building our own systems. Before we go any further, we should point out that these PC builds are designed to optimize your all-around computing experience, with some emphasis on PC gaming. What components give you the best bang for your buck depend heavily on what you''re planning to do with the system: your parts may be different if you''re building an HTPC on the same budget, or a super-speedy file server for your home network.</p>\n<p>We''ve talked about <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5151369/the-first+timers-guide-to-building-a-computer-from-scratch">our own experiences building a system</a> and why it''s important already. If you''re ready to set out on the task of building your own computer, here are the components you''ll need to build the best system you can get for your money.</p>\n<div style="background-color: #e2e0d4; padding: 16px; margin: 16px 8px 16px 8px;"><em><strong>Update - May 2013</strong>: Perhaps the biggest change to this update is that we''ve opted to include an even more budget-friendly build than our $600 PC. Our new $300 workstation is geared towards someone who just needs to get things done and might do some gaming, but doesn''t need to crank up the settings or drive a massive 1080p display. It''s also an AMD build, which you simply can''t beat when you''re looking to build a system on a budget. Our $600 and $1200 rigs are still Intel builds though, but going small in the $300 rig doesn''t mean you don''t get an practical, powerful machine that''s capable of tackling everyday tasks.<br/> <br/> Next, we''ve decided to use <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/" target="_blank">PCPartPicker</a> to put together our builds. We love it, and think you should use it too—it gives you more flexibility in your part buying, helps you eliminate possibly incompatible components, and makes sure you get he best prices for the items you plan to buy, even if it means you have to buy them from different retailers. <br/><br/>You''ll notice that below: we''ve linked to the most affordable versions of each component at the time of this writing. Prices change all the time, so if you''re checking this a few months out and the prices have gone up (or hopefully, down!) just head back to PCPartPicker and see if you can find a better price. You''ll also recognize several components in our updated builds from their previous counterparts. Part of this is because we have yet to see newer models of some critical components. We haven''t seen new processors from Intel or AMD since last year. Plus, while we''ve seen some new high-end graphics processors from AMD and NVIDIA, the bang-for-the-buck mid-to-high end cards are still the same. Similarly, while hard drive and SSD prices have dropped a bit, RAM prices have gone back up since our last update. Still, we''ve managed to squeeze in some upgrades here and there. <br/><br/>Oh, and we should note: We know the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)" target="_blank">Intel Haswell CPUs</a> are on the way next month! Once they''re out, available to consumers, and we get our hands on some benchmarks, we''ll update this guide again. <br/></em></div>\n<h3 class="has-media media-640"><img height="365" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9pmc64nrg7jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></h3>\n<h3>Build Versus Buy</h3>\n<p>The old debate over whether you should build your own system or buy a pre-built one is an old, long-standing argument that will never be easily washed away. However, there are some benefits to building your own system that can''t be weighed in terms of dollars and cents. You may be happier with your own hand-built system, or you may be able to score bargains and rebates that lead to a more powerful computer stuffed with higher quality components than a manufacturer would use.</p>\n<p>Building your own PC also gives you complete and full control over that system''s components and extendability. Unlike buying an OEM PC, assembling your own gives you the ability to make decisions about when and how you''ll upgrade that system in the long run as opposed to simply taking what the manufacturer sells you. For example, you can buy into a new motherboard chipset early and wait to spend money on the next generation of graphics card later, giving yourself a timely upgrade when the moment-or your budget-is right.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, while it may be easier to just pull out a credit card and buy whatever''s on sale from your preferred OEM, there''s something about assembling the components of a system that you''ve selected for your needs, powering it up, installing your favorite OS, and using it every day that''s'' incredibly rewarding.</p>\n<h3 class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9pqa8dde7cjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></h3><h3>Choosing The Right Parts</h3>\n<p>There was a time when building a PC was all about buying the most expensive and most powerful components you could on the budget you had. While some of that is still true, even budget components can be remarkably powerful, and if all you''re planning on doing with your system is word processing, surfing the web, and some light entertainment like streaming video or listening to music, almost any system build will work for you.</p>\n<p>You don''t need to spend a grand on high-end gaming components if you''re putting together a system for your friend who doesn''t know or care what graphics card is going into the box. At the same time, that doesn''t mean they''re doomed to a computer full of sub-standard components. We explained a few months ago that you should <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5684015/crafting-the-perfect-computer-spec-list">carefully assess your need before rushing off</a> to start pricing out components, and that advice is still true today.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, there''s no reason for you to rush out and buy the most expensive components you can afford unless you''re an enthusiast and want the most top-of-the-line system you can afford. Here we''ll detail two separate builds, a high-end system for enthusiasts and power-hungry users, and a mid-range build that will cost about half as much but still pack a punch.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9sbifzm0jipng/ku-xlarge.png" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></h3>\n<h3>The $300 Budget System</h3>\n<p>The first few times we did this guide, a few people noted that $600 and $1200 were more than enough to spend on high-powered PCs, but a good machine at around or less than $400 would be a great project. Well, here you go—not only is it possible to come in under $400, we opted for $300, and the system we put together on that budget is no slouch.</p>\n<h4>The Parts</h4>\n<p>This parts list assumes that you''ll need the basic components: a case, a motherboard, processor, memory, storage, graphics card of some type, power supply, and an optical drive. We''re going to assume you have a perfectly good USB keyboard, mouse, and display you can repurpose for use with your new system. Before you blindly buy what we''re about to suggest, take a moment and look at our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/night-school/">Lifehacker Night School</a> article on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5827145/how-to-build-a-computer-from-scratch-lesson-2-choose-and-buy-your-parts">choosing PC components</a>, where we discuss some of the things you should think about before buying your components. For example, our $300 PC here is made for economy and general use, not necessarily high-end gaming or video editing. Remember to consider what you''ll use the system for before buying.</p>\n<p>Here are the parts for our budget-friendly PC, complete with prices current as of this writing:</p>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="387" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9snyc4uwv9png/original.png" class="transform-original"/></p>\n<ul></ul><ul><li><em>The case: <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B005LIDU5S" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LIDU5S/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5840963[asin|B005LIDU5S">Rosewill FBM-01 MicroATX Mini Tower Computer Case</a> - $29.55</em>\n<p>It''s compact, it''s roomy enough to actually get your hands in there, and it''s small enough to go on top of or underneath a desk without taking up too much space. It''s not the sexiest case in the word, but it''s all black, lightweight, sports front-side USB 2.0 and audio in/out ports, has dual fans for airflow, and is well reviewed and regarded. Plus, you really can''t argue with the price tag. You could step up to a full-size tower if you want and spend some more money, maybe on a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146075" target="_blank">$40 NZXT Source 210</a> (not to be confused with the NZXT Tempest 210 we use later in this guide) if you have more to spend. For the money and the size though, this''ll do just fine.</p>\n</li><li><em>The power supply: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371033" target="_blank">Antec EarthWatts Green 380W Power Supply</a> - $45.99</em>\n<p>This build won''t take a ton of horsepower. We used <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/" target="_blank">PCPartPicker</a>''s calculator to estimate the total wattage our final build would draw (~150W) and this 380W power supply will handle that nicely and fit in our mini tower nicely. Plus, it has enough juice to power some upgrades if you ever want to add or upgrade the system, and you can take it with you to a more powerful build or roomier case if you wish. As always, just make sure you do the math on the wattage your system will likely pull down before you select a power supply, and try to buy from someone with good reviews and a solid track record of quality. If you''re not using PCPartPicker, try the <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" target="_blank">eXtreme Power Supply Calculator</a>.</p>\n</li><li><em>The motherboard: <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/yx7388-msi-a55m-p33-amd-a55-hudson-d2-amd-motherboard.html" target="_blank">MSI A55M-P33 AMD A55 (Hudson D2) FM1 MicroATX 2xDDR3 Motherboard</a> - $47.98</em>\n<p>We may have let the cat out of the bag, but our budget build is an AMD-based system. Like we said, that doesn''t mean it''s a slouch. For example, this build will give you six USB 2.0 ports, six SATA II ports, gigabit Ethernet, supports up to 16GB of RAM, and 7.1-channel on-board audio, so we won''t need to pick up a separate sound card. It packs on-board video-out, and since the AMD Trinity that we''re about to slap into it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_processing_unit" target="_blank">an APU</a>, it''ll handle graphics nicely. It doesn''t pack top of the line features like SATA III or USB 3.0, which is a bummer, but the price is right, it''s a nice, small Micro ATX board, and honestly, your peripherals are probably all (or mostly) USB 2.0 anyway.</p>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="333" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9sopycj5bhpng/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>\n<ul><li><em>The CPU: <a href="http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AD3300OJBX&amp;c=CJ" target="_blank">AMD A-Series A4-3300 2.5GHz Socket FM1 APU (CPU+GPU) Dual-Core Processor</a> - $39.99</em>\n<p>Don''t underestimate AMD''s A-Series APUs. They can handle more than you might think, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5936546/how-i-built-the-media-center-of-my-dreams-for-under-500">they''re a staple in our favorite HTPC builds</a>. Because it''s a combination CPU and GPU, this also means we don''t need to add a stand-alone graphics card in our build. The A4 has the equivalent of an AMD Radeon HD 6410D built right into it. This budget system doesn''t have to drive a living room TV at 1080p, so we stepped back a little to a slightly more modest A4 model. It''ll still handle everyday duties easily, and web video at 1080p on a wide-screen display without blinking an eye. You can even fire up some of your favorite games on this thing—and while you won''t be able to max out the settings, if you turn them down you''ll get modest framerates. If you don''t do any gaming at all though, the A4 gives you a speedy processor that can handle everyday tasks like surfing the web, watching web video, listening to local or streaming music, and getting actual work done.</p>\n</li><li><em>The memory: <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B003NWWM30" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003NWWM30/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5840963[asin|B003NWWM30">Kingston HyperX Blu 4GB (2x2GB) DDR3 1600Mhz RAM</a>  - $39.57</em>\n<p>RAM prices have gone up a bit in recent months, which is kind of a bummer, but that doesn''t mean there aren''t bargains to be had. This 4GB kit will be enough to get our budget PC up and running with <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5415355/do-you-really-need-more-than-4gb-of-ram">enough RAM for just about anything it''ll need to do</a>. The board can support up to 16GB, so if you want more RAM, you can always buy bigger sticks, but keep in mind there are only two slots on it.</p>\n</li><li><em>The storage: <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/dx5854-western-digital-caviar-blue-1tb.html" target="_blank">Western Digital 7200RPM 1TB SATA III Hard Drive</a> - $66.61</em>\n<p>Hard drive prices have stabilized since the holidays, and if you catch a sale, you can do well enough to pick up an SSD for your mid-range system along with a standard spinning, high-capacity hard drive. This $67 1TB model is speedy, sports a 64MB cache, is a solid 7200RPM drive, and is affordable enough that we decided to use it again in our $600 build below (spoilers!). If you have a different brand allegiance when it comes to drives, try this <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/mb1752.html" target="_blank">similar Seagate 1TB model</a> for a few more dollars. Whichever you choose, make sure you make note of the warranty, and, of course, keep your data backed up. Every hard drive fails, it''s just a matter of when.</p>\n</li><li><em>The optical drive: <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/c2327.html" target="_blank">Lite-On 24x CD/DVD Burner</a> - $17.98</em>\n<p>There isn''t too much to worry about when selecting an optical drive: just get something that works for your need (for example, this ASUS assumes you won''t be watching Blu-Ray videos on your PC. If you are, you may want to look at a Blu-Ray drive, like <a href="http://us.ncix.com/products/?sku=64648&amp;promoid=1280" target="_blank">this ASUS Blu-ray drive</a>, which will cost you a bit more but allow you to watch those Blu-ray discs on your system) and select a well-reviewed drive from a reputable manufacturer. If you have an optical drive from a previous build, even better.</p>\n</li><li><strong><em>The total: $287.67</em></strong></li><li><strong><em><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/alanhenry/saved/1x7t" target="_blank">Buy this build from PCPartPicker</a></em></strong></li></ul>\n<hr/>\n<h3 class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9q3vk4rv9ypng/ku-xlarge.png" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></h3>\n<h3>The Sub-$600 Midrange PC</h3>\n<p>Long gone are the days where you should immediately budget at least a grand for a decent self-built system. Unless you absolutely have to have a top of the line PC, this mid-range system will power through everyday tasks, handle PC gaming, streaming movies and music from the web, and even those bigger projects like organizing the family photos or editing home movies.</p>\n<h4>The Parts</h4>\n<p>Again, we''re going to assume you have a perfectly good USB keyboard, mouse, and display you can repurpose for use with your new system. Our $600 PC here is made with bang-for-the-buck in mind, something that will earn you high performance without breaking the bank—not necessarily silent operation or tons of expansion bays. Remember to consider what you''ll use the system for before buying. You may very well want to tweak some of the components we suggest below.</p>\n<p>Here are the parts for our mid-range PC, complete with prices current as of this writing:</p>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="324" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/181xqajodv0n3png/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>\n<ul></ul><ul><li><em>The case: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146084" target="_blank">NZXT Tempest 210</a> - $44.99</em>\n<p>The NZXT Tempest 210 is a roomy mid-sized case that, thanks to its steel body, is both lightweight and should last you longer than just this build. It''s large enough to accommodate all but the largest components, and roomy enough to move your hands around inside without too much of a squeeze. The case is loaded with grips to easily remove drive bays inside without a screwdriver, slots to route your cables through cleanly, extra fan grills for superior airflow and cooling, it''s just a nicely designed case. You also get a pair of 120mm fans for your money, an enlarged CPU cut-out to accomodate after-market cooling, and front-side audio and USB ports (including a USB 3.0 port) are a nice bonus in this budget case. Plus, our own Whitson Gordon swears by NZXT cases, both for their interior space and how easy it is to install and remove components from them.</p>\n</li><li><em>The power supply: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139027" target="_blank">Corsair Builder Series CX500 500W Power Supply</a> - $49.99</em>\n<p>Most PC builders, especially starting off, tend to completely overestimate how much power their components will actually need. At the same time, you don''t want to buy a power supply too weak for the components in your build, or buy one from a flaky manufacturer or a no-name brand. Stick with trusted vendors on this one, and spend a little more if you have to. This 500-watt power supply from Corsair should be enough for our components, and Corsair is a trusted name. Pay attention to warranties and return policies as well, but try to make sure you''re getting the right amount of juice for the system you''re building. If you have a few more dollars, the same power supply comes in <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=17-139-050&amp;Tpk=17-139-050" target="_blank">a modular version</a> for $70, which is out of our budget but will keep your case nice and clean. There are some great calculators on the web that will help you determine how big your power supply should really be, like the <a href="http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp" target="_blank">eXtreme Power Supply Calculator</a>.</p>\n</li><li><em>The motherboard: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157330" target="_blank">ASRock Z77 Extreme3 LGA 1155 ATX Intel Motherboard</a> - $119.99</em>\n<p>Whether you''re a gamer or you''re building a system for productivity, this LGA 1155 board is rock solid, reliable, and sports some high-end features for not a ton of money. You''ll get 6 USB ports (two of which are USB 3.0), four 3.0Gb/s SATA ports and two 6Gb/s SATA ports, gigabit Ethernet, and on-board sound, so we won''t need to pick up a separate sound card. It packs on-board video, (so you could ditch video card below and save some more money), but you''ll need a CPU that supports integrated graphics processing, since the board won''t do it for you alone. Still, this is a great, upgradable board that''s perfect if you want to upgrade to a more powerful processor, or an SSD that can push data through those 6Gb/s SATA channels.</p>\n</li></ul>\n\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="283" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/181xfq6hywww6png/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>\n<ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><em>The CPU: <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B0093H8HXS" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0093H8HXS/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5840963[asin|B0093H8HXS">Intel Core i3-3220 Ivy Bridge 3.3Ghz Dual Core Processor</a> - $120.98</em>\n<p>As usual, we''re going Intel in the mid-range build. Again, there''s no reason you couldn''t sub this out for an AMD processor (and AMD-compatible motherboard) if you wanted to, and <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/trinity-gaming-performance,3304.html" target="_blank">AMD''s Trinity platform</a>, which sports some seriously solid integrated graphics for cheap. However, we landed on the Ivy Bridge Core i3. It''s a solid processor that fits in our budget, offers <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/10qg3k/how_good_are_i3_processors/" target="_blank">better gaming performance</a> than you might think, and will tackle almost anything else you throw at it. If you aren''t much of a gamer but run a lot of CPU-intensive processes, like converting or editing video, we recommend upgrading to the <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B0087EVHTE" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087EVHTE/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5840963[asin|B0087EVHTE">Core i5-3570</a>. It''ll give you a bit of extra power for those tasks, and its integrated graphics mean you can ditch having a video card altogether and stay under budget.</p>\n</li><li><em>The memory: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231427&amp;" target="_blank">G.SKILL 4GB (2x2GB) DDR3 1600 RAM</a> - $36.99</em><br/>\n<p>RAM prices have spiked since our last update, and this 4GB kit that used to be $20 is now well over $30. Still, it''s a solid set, and it fits into our budget. One of the most important things about buying memory is to make sure you get RAM that''s compatible with your build, and that''s from a reputable memory manufacturer. G. Skill is well known and makes high quality desktop memory. Our board is dual-channel, so we want to make sure we take advantage of it, and 4GB of RAM is enough for our everyday PC. Of course, if you have more to spend, you could add more to the build, maybe with <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231422" target="_blank">this 8GB kit (2x4GB) from G. Skill</a> for $61.99.</p>\n</li><li><em>The storage: <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/dx5854-western-digital-caviar-blue-1tb.html" target="_blank">Western Digital 7200RPM 1TB SATA III Hard Drive</a> - $66.61</em>\n<p>Like we mentioned, Hard drive prices have recovered a good bit from where they were even a few years ago, and this Western Digital model will serve your mid-range PC well. It packs SATA III, sports a 64MB cache, is a solid 7200RPM drive, and its price can''t be beat. Still, hard drive prices haven''t dipped so much that we could slap an SSD into this build, although we really wanted to. Again, it''s a Caviar Blue, meaning it''s one of Western Digital''s all-purpose, everyday use drives, so don''t expect crazy read/write speeds like a Caviar Black, but the cache and spin speed are right for the price. If you have a different brand allegiance when it comes to drives, try this <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/mb1752.html" target="_blank">similar Seagate 1TB model</a> for a few more dollars. Whichever you choose, make sure you make note of the warranty, and, of course, keep your data backed up.

As usual, we''re offering up an AMD and NVIDIA option so you can choose your side accordingly. Like so many other components, it''s easy to get caught up in which brand you prefer, but both of these cards pack enough power for everyday tasks, full HD video, and more than casual gaming. These cards can handle just about anything you throw at them, on high-to-max settings even. If you''re powering a 1080p display, maybe something upwards of 22&quot;-27&quot;, you shouldn''t have much of a problem, although you might need to turn things down if your framerates suffer. We might be a little optimistic, but you should be able to crank up <em>Dishonored</em> or <em>Bioshock Infinite</em> to high and get solid framerates with these cards. If you''re not gaming at all, you won''t even notice—streaming and local video will play silky smooth.</p>\n</li><li><em>The optical drive: <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/c2327.html" target="_blank">Lite-On 24x CD/DVD Burner</a> - $17.98</em>\n<p>There isn''t too much to worry about when selecting an optical drive: just get something that works for your need (for example, this ASUS assumes you won''t be watching Blu-Ray videos on your PC. If you are, you may want to look at a Blu-Ray drive, like <a href="http://us.ncix.com/products/?sku=64648&amp;promoid=1280" target="_blank">this ASUS Blu-ray drive</a>, which will cost you a bit more but allow you to watch those Blu-ray discs on your system) and select a well-reviewed drive from a reputable manufacturer.

That doesn''t mean there isn''t room to improve it, or cut it down a bit if it''s too much. You could get below $500 by swapping in a cheaper processor (like the graphics-heavy <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819113280&amp;Tpk=amd%20a10" target="_blank">AMD A10-5800K</a> noted above, or even a Sandy Bridge <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116397" target="_blank">Intel G850</a>) or opting for less powerful motherboard. If you go AMD, note that you''ll need an AMD-compatible motherboard as well. But, if you have a little more to spend, you can get some big boosts for not much more money.</p>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="231" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9qopbtxoa7png/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>If you have a few more dollars to spend, consider upgrading the RAM in the system from 4GB to 8GB using the kit mentioned above (or max out the board, if you want). If you''re interested in gaming, you could probably get away with a beefier graphics card than the ones we opted for above. For example, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202004" target="_blank">this AMD Radeon HD 7850</a> is a step up from the 7770 in our build, and it''s only about $40 more. A little more will get you <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102999" target="_blank">the 2GB version of the 7850</a>.

You can pick up even a 64GB SSD for <a href="http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=CT064M4SSD&amp;c=CJ" target="_blank">around $70</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3 class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9r07ogql6zpng/ku-xlarge.png" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></h3>\n<h3>The Sub-$1200 Enthusiast''s PC</h3>\n<p>Now that we''ve covered two systems that can be purchased and assembled on a decent budgets, now it''s time to have some fun. First, we''re not targeting our upper limit here, we just want to give you an idea of some of the high-end components that would make a good enthusiast''s build. If you''re a fan of PC gaming, have to play the latest releases as soon as they''re out, have multiple huge, high-resolution displays, or just want the beefiest box you can afford, this build is for you.</p>\n<h4>The Parts</h4>\n<p>As with the $600 PC above, we''re going to assume you have the basics, like a keyboard, mouse, and display. In this case though, we''re going for the big, pretty, and powerful, as opposed to trying to keep the budget down. We won''t necessarily aim directly for our high-end, but we will slap in some pricier components that we know would make a noticeable difference in your computing experience if you had them in your system.</p>\n<p>Again, remember to consider your use case before buying – the people who''ll really love this build will be PC gamers, media professionals, and enthusiasts who want to futureproof themselves or just prefer the top of the line.</p>\n<p>Here are the parts for our mid-range PC, complete with prices current as of this writing:</p>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="304" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/181xge0slcz6apng/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>\n<ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><em>The case: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139008" target="_blank">Corsair Carbide Series 400R</a> - $99.99</em>\n<p>The Corsair Carbide 400R was our choice of case last time, and it''s still a great model. Its price hasn''t changed, but that''s okay. It''s sleek black, lightweight steel and plastic, and has 6 expansion bays and 8 PCI slots on the rear. It has top, rear, and optional front and side case fans to keep your system cool, and a front-side I/O panel for power, USB 3.0, and audio. You won''t get a power supply with the case, but the 400R is a robust case that will stand the test of time, and has plenty of room inside for upgrades if you want them, or long graphics cards or after-market CPU cooling. Warning though: there are some very pretty cases on the market – buy one that has the features and look that <em>you</em> want. Looking for a side-window? Grab the pricier <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811139009" target="_blank">Carbide 500R</a>. Want more options? We just did <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5951431/five-best-desktop-computer-cases?tag=hive-five">a Hive Five on desktop computer cases with some great picks</a> (although most were a bit more expensive, like the winner: the $180 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119225" target="_blank">Cooler Master HAF X</a>), or you could save money with the slightly smaller $60 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119233" target="_blank">Cooler Master HAF 912</a>, or spend nothing and repurpose an old case from a previous build.</p>\n</li><li><em>The power supply: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139020" target="_blank">CORSAIR Enthusiast Series TX650 V2 650W High Performance Power Supply</a> - $89.99</em>\n<p>Speaking of Corsair, the company makes good power supplies, and 650-watts of juice should be enough to power even the most demanding components. If you want one, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139031" target="_blank">$15 will buy you this model in a modular variety</a>. Either way, this case doesn''t have windows, we''ll save the dough. You read Lifehacker, you can probably manage your cables. This power supply is quiet, comes with a +12V rail a high-powered graphics card, and offers enthusiast-level power output at a solid price. There are more expensive power supplies out there, but this one gets the job done without being overkill.</p>\n</li><li><em>The motherboard: <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B007R21JK4" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007R21JK4/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5840963[asin|B007R21JK4">GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UD5H LGA 1155 Intel ATX Motherboard</a> - $174.98</em>\n<p>It''s definitely pricey, but this board picked up an <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6108/gigabyte-gaz77xud5h-review-functionality-meets-competitive-pricing" target="_blank">editor''s choice award at AnandTech</a> for its ports, power, and features, and that''s a big deal for AnandTech (who''s normally a bit critical of Gigabyte boards.) Want USB 3.0? This board has it. Need dual LAN? Sure, why not. The board supports Intel''s latest Core processors, and even offers a few tools for overclockers. The board also has built-in support for Crossfire (AMD) and SLI (NVIDIA) for high-end gaming with multiple graphics cards, sports 6 USB 3.0 and 4 USB 2.0 ports, on-board HDMI, dual gigabit Ethernet, supports on-board RAID, has 9 SATA ports (5 at 6Gb/s and 4 at 3Gb/s) and packs built-in audio and video. It''s definitely a high-end board for a system builder who needs the features or isn''t concerned about the budget.

After all, this is the same processor that <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/build-a-pc-overclock-benchmark,3276.html" target="_blank">Tom''s Hardware put in their $1000 gaming PC</a>, and our friends at Logical Incriments think this—not the i7—is the best processor for high-end performance, especially in gaming. We think it''ll handle whatever you throw at it pretty handily, and besides: The only difference between the i5 and the i7 is the hyperthreading, which you''d only miss if you''re doing high-end video encoding, 3D rendering, or video editing. For gaming and everyday use, you won''t notice it''s missing at all. Want to overclock and get a little more for your money? Grab the <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/sd3283.html" target="_blank">$219 i5-3570k instead</a>.

If you do 3D rendering, video editing and encoding, or regularly run applications that can make use of the hyperthreading, then by all means, spring for the i7. We tried to cram an i7 into this build, doing so would have bumped us over budget.</p>\n</li><li><em>The memory: <a href="http://us.ncix.com/products/?sku=44267&amp;vpn=F3-12800CL9D-8GBRL&amp;manufacture=G.Skill" target="_blank">G Skill 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1600 RAM</a> - $59.82</em>\n<p>Let''s be clear, 4GB of RAM is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5415355/do-you-really-need-more-than-4gb-of-ram">probably sufficient for most systems</a>, but this is an enthusiast''s PC. Double the RAM from the previous build and your computing experience will overall feel faster and snappier. Depending on what you use the system for, you could scale back to 4GB, but if you''re going to do serious gaming, you''ll want the extra RAM. To that point, more memory is better than faster memory, so don''t feel bad for picking DDR3 1333 over something technically faster. Buy with caution, and keep in mind what you''re going to be doing with the system. If you have the budget to go wild, you could just load up the board and call it a day.</p>\n</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="244" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9rfzx4sdy6png/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p>\n<ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><em>The storage: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147163" target="_blank">Samsung 830 Series 128GB SATA III MLC SSD</a> - $114.99 + <a href="http://www.adorama.com/WD1002FAEX.html" target="_blank">Western Digital WD Black 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s Hard Drive</a> - $88.99</em>\n<p>Some of our old favorite SSDs are no longer available, but there are others that perform just as well. Both of these drives are solid entries, and are both super fast. We''ve said several times that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5793366/is-ssd-worth-it-performance-tests-with-macbook-pro">a Solid State Drive (SSD) is one of the best upgrades you can buy</a> for your computer, but if you''re building one from scratch with performance in mind, consider buying an SSD for your OS and applications, and a traditional hard drive for files and data. Still not sold? Let us help: we can assure you <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5616023/are-solid+state-drives-worth-the-money">SSDs are worth the money</a>. The only trick is picking one that''s large enough for your OS and applications. If you don''t like this model, there are plenty of others to choose from—smaller and larger. I''ve had good experiences with Crucial, OCZ (even though rumor is they''re leaving the business), and Intel SSDs, but you can always <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5932009/the-complete-guide-to-solid+state-drives">read our complete guide to SSDs</a> to learn what to check for before you buy.</p>\n</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="273" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18m9rueucs1y0png/original.png" class="transform-original"/></p>\n<ul></ul><ul></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><em>The graphics card: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150588" target="_blank">AMD Radeon HD 7950 3GB</a> - $299.99 /<a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B008S15X64" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008S15X64/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5840963[asin|B008S15X64">NVIDIA GeForce 660 Ti 3GB</a> - $312.98</em>\n<p>We really didn''t have to pack such high-end cards into this system, and you don''t either frankly, if you''re not looking for gaming performance. Plus, since the major titles that have come out since our last update haven''t put a strain on last year''s graphics cards, we wouldn''t blame you if you opted to scale back to a more affordable model. Even so, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/bench/GPU12/372" target="_blank">Anandtech''s latest GPU Benchmark tests</a> put these guys ahead of the middle of the pack, with respectable benchmarks. If you''re a PC gamer and you love turning up all of the settings on your games, or you have to play all of the latest releases as soon as they''re out, pick your brand allegiance (or better yet, check how each of these two cards performs when benchmarked in your favorite games) and go with one of these. If you need even more power and have the money to buy it (really?), consider the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125413" target="_blank">AMD Radeon HD 7970</a> ($399.99) or the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125423" target="_blank">NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670</a> ($399.99) for some gorgeous-but-wallet-busting graphical goodness. While we''re shooting the moon, how about that <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130899" target="_blank">$1000 GeForce GTX Titan</a>?</p>\n</li><li><em>The optical drive: <a href="http://www.outletpc.com/c2327.html" target="_blank">Lite-On 24x CD/DVD Burner</a> - $17.98</em>\n<p>Surprised? We meant it when we said in the budget section that the optical drive that you buy doesn''t really matter. Again, if you''re planning to watch Blu-ray video on your enthusiast PC, you''ll want to spring for the appropriate drive, but if you''re not, we can''t find a better optical drive and disc burner for the money. Hey, just because there are more expensive ones out there doesn''t mean they''re <em>better</em>. Just because you''re on an enthusiast''s budget doesn''t mean you have to throw your money away.</p>\n</li><li><strong><em>The total: $1171.41</em></strong></li><li><strong><em><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/alanhenry/saved/1x7l" target="_blank">Buy this build from PCPartPicker</a></em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you''re on a budget…</strong><br/> Sometimes building an enthusiast''s PC is more difficult than building a budget one because you have room in the budget to buy high-end components, but you don''t want to go overboard or make decisions that waste your money. We hope this sub $1200 build walks the line between spending good money on components that matter without spending too much on the ones that don''t.</p>\n<p>If this is too much though, some of the biggest money sinks here are clearly the video card and the processor. While you could bump down a more affordable motherboard and save about $30, the real savings is in choosing a less powerful and high-end video card, especially since you can upgrade a video card more easily than a processor. Consider the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102993" target="_blank">AMD Radeon HD 7770</a> ($129.99) we mentioned earlier.

The reason for that is because we don''t want to assume what operating system you''ll install on your build. If you want to go Linux, then your cost is basically nothing. If you''d rather install Microsoft Windows-and we assume most of you would-Windows 8 is where it''s at right now (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5974318/downgrade-your-new-windows-8-computer-to-windows-7-for-free">unless you plan to downgrade</a>) at an array of different prices depending on the version you want and where you get it.</p>\n<p>Newegg has OEM versions of <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832416550" target="_blank">Windows 8 64-bit</a> for $99.99, which is likely what most of you would buy Enthusiasts can grab the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832416552" target="_blank">$139 Windows 8 Professional x64</a> if needed, but odds are you won''t need the added features. At the same time, you can probably score a cheaper copy <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5700743/how-to-get-student-discounts-forever">with an educational discount if you have one</a>, or through an employee purchase program if your workplace has a enterprise licensing agreement with Microsoft.</p>\n<h3>Additional Reading</h3>\n<p>Don''t take our word for these builds. We''re sure you have your own opinions on what should have made it in and what should have been excluded. We also stuck with Newegg for pricing and component information, which you certainly don''t have to do-especially if you can find the same components you want elsewhere for less (or better ones for the same price!)</p>\n<p>One reference that-at least for now-is constantly updated and invaluable for determining exactly <em>how</em> enthusiast you''re being when it comes to the components you''re buying and how much you should be spending on them is the <a href="http://www.logicalincrements.com/" target="_blank">Logical Increments PC Buying Guide</a>. We used it as a reference extensively here, and the site''s recently been redesigned so it''s super user friendly. It''s a big help, and can serve as a good sanity check if your build is getting out of hand.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to read up on your most critical components before you buy. <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/bench/GPU12/372" target="_blank">Anandtech''s GPU benchmarks</a> and the <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/" target="_blank">Tom''s Hardware forums</a> are invaluable when looking for benchmarks and opinions on some of the components you may buy before you add them to your cart. The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc" target="_blank">Reddit Build-A-PC</a> subreddit is also a great place to ask for opinions and guidance if you''re having issues or just want the thoughts of people who have been where you are now.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>We''ll come back to this system builder''s guide regularly to make sure it''s updated with current pricing information and the best components for each of our builds.

Nevertheless, solitude can make you more self-sufficient, add to your confidence, and help you get to know yourself a lot better.  If being alone scares you, bores you, or just isn’t your favorite thing, here’s how you can fix that and make your time more productive.</p>\n<p>You, like many people, might get stuck on the idea that being alone is like having some sort of disease—even if you’re the kind of person that prefers being alone.  You might skip movies in the theater if you have to attend in solitude.  Or maybe you criticize yourself for eating lunch at your desks instead of with coworkers or friends.  Perhaps you spend too much of our time out with others because you just don’t know what to do when you’re by yourself.  With a little work, however, you can make your alone time much more productive.  With the help of <a href="http://www.luvbuzd.tv/videos" target="_blank">Roger S. Gil</a>, a clinician specializing in marriage and family therapy, and <a href="http://www.ericklinenberg.com/" target="_blank">Eric Klinenberg</a>, professor of sociology at NYU and author of <a href="http://www.ericklinenberg.com/books#going-solo-the-extraordinary-rise-and-surprising-appeal-of-living-alone" target="_blank">Going Solo</a>, we’ll to look at the benefits of solitude and how you can use them to your advantage.</p>\n<h3>You Can Engage in Productive Introspection</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="419" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18lrjbr6kkzdujpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p><br/>The parts of being alone that frighten us can actually help us.  When nobody else distracts us, we have the opportunity to become introspective.  You, like many others, may not look forward to moments of introspection.  The idiom “you are your own worst enemy” exists because we tend to criticize ourselves more harshly than anyone else.  Nevertheless, if you engage in introspection productively, you can wind up feeling better rather than worse.  Roger explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By taking the time to understand what our core beliefs are about ourselves, others, and the world at large, we can gain greater insights into our own thought processes and how our minds work.  &quot;Alone time&quot; helps us shut out the noise introduced by others and get to inspecting our emotional baggage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead of criticizing recent behaviors or worrying about the future, use introspection to think about what you believe and what matters to you.  Spend a little time considering the positive actions you took in a given day or week.  When analyzing personal weaknesses, think about how you may improve.  Negative thoughts tend to find their way to the forefront of our minds when we have no other distractions, and that’s okay.  Just approach them productively.  See your alone time as an opportunity to solve problems through introspection and get to know yourself better rather than a time to dwell on the downsides of your life.</p>\n<h3>You Get to Do Whatever You Want</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="427" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18lrjcso9hianjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p><br/>Some people don’t hate being alone so much as they find it boring.  When you’re with others, you have the advantage of multiple minds thinking of an enjoyable activity.  When you’re alone, you’re left with the job entirely.  While sometimes daunting, when you only have to please yourself you can try anything and you won’t find yourself making many decisions if you keep an open mind.</p>\n<p>Personally, when I have little to do I like to pick a place I haven’t been and wander around.  When I have no agenda, I can pay closer attention to my surroundings and I almost always find something interesting happening nearby.  This allows me to not only try something new but also experience it unencumbered by the opinions of others.  While you might think you form unique opinions regardless of who you are with, that’s not really the case.  Roger explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The influence of others'' opinions plays a huge role in the establishment of trends and what the mainstream feels is good or bad.  Being by ourselves removes the biases that others may introduce into our opinions.  Forming our beliefs about something before bringing others into the mix helps us get a clearer picture of what it is that we actually like and want. A great example of how others'' opinions can sway our own often happens when a person is determining whether or not someone is a potential mate.  If you constantly consult friends and rely on their opinions to form your own then you may allow their own preferences and biases to overshadow your own feelings. The danger in this is that you may ignore someone who is more your type and focusing on people that are more acceptable to your social circle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The same issues occur with most anything you do.  If you’re like most people, you won’t see a movie alone even though you might enjoy it less with friends.  Whether you like it or not, the opinions of others in your social circle affect yours and you may leave liking a movie less if your friends didn’t care for it.  Seeing it on your own, however, allows you to think about it without outside influence.  Not only does this increase the likelihood of enjoyment, but it also helps you develop a more accurate picture of what you enjoy and what matters to you.</p>\n<h3>You Become More Self-Sufficient</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><span class="flex-video vimeo widescreen"><iframe mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitAllowFullScreen="webkitAllowFullScreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" class="youtube" height="360" width="640" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/3850863" id="vimeo-3850863"></iframe></span></p><p><br/>Increased solitude equals increased self-reliance.  If you can’t count on others for everything you do, you have to learn to do quite a bit more yourself.  Of course, you should rely on others sometimes, but alone time helps you create a balance between getting help from others and relying on yourself.  If you have trouble getting things done without the encouragement and help of others, Roger suggests solitude as a potential solution:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Depending on others too much can lead to people who do not learn the life skills necessary to function effectively on their own.  Being alone and forcing yourself to get something done is a great way to start breaking free from <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/enmeshment-symptoms-and-causes-125738708.html" target="_blank">enmeshment</a> (“a relationship between two or more people in which personal boundaries are permeable and unclear”).  Even if the outcome of your new undertaking isn''t ideal, the fact that you tried on your own can go a long way toward helping you feel more comfortable with doing something unfamiliar the next time around.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You have many options if you want to try and get something done on your own.  You don’t have to start big and, say, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5744113/learn-to-code-the-full-beginners-guide">learn to code</a>, but rather can start a small <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/diy">DIY project</a> or even <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5975750/how-can-i-keep-a-personal-private-journal-online">start a journal</a>.  The more you learn to do on your own the more self-sufficient you become, making it easier to handle tasks on your own when you can’t rely on friends.  In addition to becoming more capable and productive, you’ll have fun finding new ways to spend your time.</p>\n<h3>Remember to Keep a Good Balance</h3>\n<p>Although this post advocates spending time alone, you need balance.  You can’t live a life without engaging with others, wherever those interactions fall on the scale of superficial to intimate.  That balance falls in a unique place for each of us, as Eric explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We do know that social isolation is dangerous, so the trick is to balance solitude with social activity in a way that suits you. Remember that for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" target="_blank">Emerson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_david_thoreau" target="_blank">Thoreau</a>, the point of having solitude was not to retreat from the world altogether, but to prepare for a more productive return.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spending time alone doesn’t make you bereft of human connection.  You can interact with others when you explore, and even technology can help you avoid isolation.  Eric notes, however, that technology can hurt the benefits of solitude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology helps to connect us but it makes being alone difficult. Today you can be home alone and intensely involved in social activity. That''s both a challenge and an opportunity, and we don''t yet know how it will change us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You’ll need to figure out the right balance of social activity for you, and you can only do that by attempting to make your time alone more productive and figure out how much of it suits your needs.  You don’t want to become a loner, but you don’t want to become enmeshed with others either.  Nevertheless, if you embrace both your social activity as well as your solitude you can look forward to everything you do.</p>\n<p><small><em>A very special thanks goes out to <a href="http://www.luvbuzd.tv/videos" target="_blank">Roger S.

This weekend, pick one of the many ways to purge yourself of procrastination and start getting things done.</p>\n<h3>Remove Your Distractions</h3>\n<p>Procrastination is brought to you by <em>distraction</em>.  While you can put something off without alternatives like Facebook, Twitter, video games, and any number of other things you''d rather do, they certainly make it a lot easier.  While you should get into the habit of choosing to put off distractions rather than the task at hand, a few tools can help you do that when your willpower could stand to be a bit stronger.</p>\n<p>Chrome users can turn to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5780575">StayFocusd</a>, and extension that blocks distracting sites.  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/" target="_blank">LeechBlock</a> will get the job done on Firefox.  Of course, there are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5894460/how-can-i-steer-clear-of-distractions-and-focus-while-i-work">several other options</a>, some of which will even <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5816569/get-shit-done-blocks-distracting-web-sites-so-you-can-do-as-the-name-instructs">modify your hosts file</a> so you can''t get to sites in any browser.  But before you can start blocking anything, you need to figure out what''s distracting you the most.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5839691/how-to-reclaim-your-time-in-seven-days-with-rescuetime">Set up RescueTime</a> to track your activity and figure it out.  Then you can use that information to eliminate distractions as much as possible.</p>\n<h3>Pick an Anti-Procrastination Plan</h3>\n<p>Everyone''s a little bit different, so some anti-procrastination plans work better for some than others.  Personally, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem">Seinfeld''s productivity trick fixed my procrastination problem</a>, but it you have to be a little neurotic to actually enjoy it.  A lot of people love the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5377906/the-pomodoro-technique-fights-deadline-anxiety-with-a-timer">Pomodoro Technique</a> (it''s our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5890829/most-popular-productivity-method-the-pomodoro-technique">reader favorite</a>), which uses a cyclical timer to help you focus on short bursts of work while providing frequent breaks as well.  If a specific method just feels like too much, simply <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5984985/why-productive-procrastination-makes-your-dreaded-tasks-easier-to-get-done">structuring and planning for procrastination</a> can help you avoid it when you need to.  Just don''t trust your instincts.  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5954196/five-counterintuitive-ways-to-use-procrastination-and-become-productive">Beating procrastination is often counter-intuitive</a>.</p>\n<h3>Set Up a Reward System</h3>\n<p>Regardless of what tools or tricks might be able to help you, nothing will change if you don''t put in the effort to change. You can''t just flip a switch, wait, and stop wasting time. You have to wean yourself off of it. Set an allowance for how often you can engage in certain leisure activities and reward yourself if you succeed. There are lots of ways you can incentivize creating good habits, so just pick a reward that you''ll appreciate and if you meet your goals you get it. If not, you don''t. You need to have willpower, but incentives provide a little bit of encouragement.</p>\n<p>Leisure activities, themselves, can be the reward. You may prefer to reward yourself with something like a cupcake or a new game you''ve wanted to by. As you go along, however, the rewards should decrease. Doing your work and feeling accomplished needs to be a reward in itself, or your entire system can fall apart the moment you accidentally drop your prized cupcake on the sidewalk. Implementing a reward system can help in the beginning, but eventually hard work needs to be its own reward.</p>\n<p><em>Happy Friday!</em></p>', '', '', '2013-04-27 12:00:00', '', 'weekendhacker', '480409472', '2013-05-18 18:59:54'),

If you want to, there''s room in there for higher-end components like full size ATX power supplies, aftermarket cooling, and (somewhat) larger video cards, but it doesn''t sacrifice a small footprint to give it all to you. You get surprising airflow in a small form factor (9.4&quot; W x 8.2&quot; H x 15.8&quot; D), with vents on the top and side, large fans on the front, side, and on the hard drive cage. Four drive bays are ready for your hard drives and optical drive, two expansion ports in the back for peripheral cards, and you get USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports on the front to connect your devices, along with frontside audio.

The former is a Micro-ATX/Mini-ITX chassis, and the latter supports Mini-ITX and DTX builds. The FT03 sports four internal bays for drives, four expansion slots, top and bottom exhaust fans for airflow, no cables at all on four sides, but a tucked away front side panel with USB 3.0 and audio ports. It supports standard ATX power supplies, has plenty of room to work inside, and even supports (some) large video cards. The FT03 Mini on the other hand cuts back a bit: three internal bays, one bottom fan, and two expansion slots, but can still support a long graphics card and has those front-side ports. You''ll need an SFX power supply for it though (The FT03 standard model will accept a regular PSU).

The flexible, soft-grip handles make for portability and good looks, and has plenty of room inside to work. It''s a little bigger than some smaller Mini-ITX cases (9.8&quot; W x 15.9&quot;H x 14.1&quot;D) and it still gets great airflow thanks to front and rear cooling fans (with space for more). The added room means you get space for six expansion bays inside, 2 expansion card slots (that support long cards, like graphics cards), and support for a standard ATX power supply. Ports on the side near the front of the chassis give you access to USB 3.0 ports, power, and audio. Plus, if you want your rig to stand out, it''s available in a ton of colors (including orange and red), although the standards are black and white. Best of all, it''s not expensive—it''ll set you back $90 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811345017" target="_blank">at Newegg</a>, $100 <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="B008RJQ3GQ" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/BitFenix-Prodigy-Arctic-White/dp/B008RJQ3GQ/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5994570[asin|B008RJQ3GQ">at Amazon</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="448" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kmpj9jraigljpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.mini-box.com/M350-universal-mini-itx-enclosure" target="_blank">Mini-Box M350 Universal Mini-ITX</a></h3>\n<p>A lot of the cases in this roundup are still a little on the large side, or shaped like smaller versions of towers. The Mini-Box M350 Universal Mini-ITX Enclosure is different. it takes a few cues from the long, flat boxes of computers gone by, but still looks small and sleek enough to fit nicely in an entertainment center or next to a TV as an HTPC, or under a monitor as a space-saving workstation. The thing is small enough (7.5&quot;W x 2.4&quot;H x 8.3&quot; D) you could even mount it on the back of a widescreen display for an all-in-one look and feel. You''ll need a PicoPSU to power the thing (and it''s <a href="http://www.mini-box.com/M350-enclosure-with-picoPSU-80-and-60W-adapter" target="_blank">available with a PSU kit</a> so you don''t have to worry about that), but you also get a super-silent fanless design, space for any processor (as long as it has stock cooling), space for 2 hard drives in mountable bays, and while you''re not going to fit a huge video card in there, there are tons of bracket options inside to fit additional components. It''s available in black or silver, for $40 direct from the manufacturer. If you want the model with the power supply adapter included, that''ll bring it up to $70.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="470" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kg5nag9hw7gjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.fractal-design.com/?view=product&amp;prod=94" target="_blank">Fractal Design Node 304</a></h3>\n<p>Fractal Design''s cases are all simple, good-looking cases that get the job done but aren''t super-flashy in the process. They''re all good looking, but the Node 304 specifically would look great in an entertainment center or on top of a desk; whatever you choose to do with it. It''s a Mini-ITX case that''s surprisingly roomy for its size (9.8&quot; W x 8.3&quot; H x 14.7&quot; D), supports a standard PSU, has six drive bays for your hard drives (no optical drives, as the front of the case doesn''t have a slot for one), two expansion slots for cards on the back, and it''s long enough to support longer graphics cards if you need them (but you''ll want to make sure they fit with the PSU first). It sports two front-side fans and one rear for airflow, supports aftermarket cooling for CPUs, and gives you a pair of USB 3.0 ports, audio ports, and power right on the front of the chassis. It''s a sharp, grown-up design that doesn''t sacrifice quality for build, and it''ll set you back $90 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352027" target="_blank">at Newegg</a> and closer to $122 <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fractal-Design-Mini-ITX-Computer-FD-CA-NODE-304-BL/?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5994570">at Amazon</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Now that you''ve seen the top five, it''s time to put them to a vote to determine the Lifehacker community favorite:</p>\n<p><script src="http://static.polldaddy.com/p/7034041.js"></script></p>\n<noscript><a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/7034041/" target="_blank">What''s The Best Small Form Factor PC Case?</a></noscript>\n<p>Honorable mentions this week go out to <strong><a href="http://www.fractal-design.com/?view=product&amp;category=2&amp;prod=58" target="_blank">Fractal Design Define Mini</a></strong>, a case that barely missed the top five by one or two nominations—but that''s okay, we know it''s well loved: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5951431/five-best-desktop-computer-cases">It took second place in our last poll</a> about PC cases!</p>\n<p>Still, we collected well over 30 different cases from your nominations this week, and dozens more votes.

Our brains have a way of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5719077/avoid-added-stress-by-just-deciding-and-moving-forward">synthesizing happiness</a> even if we make the &quot;wrong&quot; decision, so as long as it doesn''t have serious lasting consequences, you may be better off flipping a coin than you are going through all that stress for no reason.<br/></p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>4. Laugh Out Loud</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18ixm9ee4dfrhjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>We all know laughing can put us in a better mood, but it''s a better stress cure than you may realize. Studies show that people who laugh the &quot;most heartily,&quot; according to WebMD, show bigger drops in stress levels when watching a funny movie. Laughter really is the best medicine, and while it isn''t always possible to plop down on the couch and watch your favorite comedy, you can stick a few of your favorite standup routines on your iPod and sneak them in when you''re feeling stressed.<br/></p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>3. Exercise</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17xahib7kxvwwjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>Going for a jog isn''t exactly the most fun thing to do when you''re stressed, but when you''re done, it can help you feel so much better. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5412202/exercise-prepares-our-bodies-for-stressful-situations-study-indicates">Exercise prepares your body for stress</a>, because your body thinks you''re in a stressful situation (like you''re fleeing for your life). So, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5938216/what-happens-to-our-brains-during-exercise-and-why-it-makes-us-happier">your brain releases chemicals to help fight that stress</a>, which is why you feel that endorphin high after you''re finished. Even if it''s short, get a little exercise in and you''ll feel much better.<br/></p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>2. Meditate</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kid9gpjwwccjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>Ever hear someone to tell you to just &quot;take deep breaths&quot; when you''re stressed? They''re not far off. Meditation isn''t the silly, cross-legged, hovering-in-the-air thing you see in cartoons—it''s actually <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5989429/is-meditation-really-beneficial-or-is-it-just-ridiculous">an incredibly beneficial way</a> to calm you down, improve your focus, and get rid of distractions in your mind. It doesn''t take a lot, either—all you really need to do is sit comfortably and breathe deeply and slowly, focusing your attention on your breath and away from all that stuff that''s stressing you out.

These techniques can still help, but the best thing you can do is fight your chronic stress at the source.

This weekend we''re assuming you''re a pack rat rather than a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5991832/declutter-in-your-life-and-embrace-minimalism-this-weekend">minimalist</a> and have a number of DIY projects to help you stash more stuff. </p>\n<h3>The Kitchen</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18jpdg91ep9hojpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>Most kitchens come with a few shelves and drawers. If you''re lucky, you get a pantry as well. Even with all this storage you may not have enough room for all your pots, pans, utensils, food, and whatever else because you''re not storing everything in the most efficient manner. Pots, for example, love to take up far more space than they need and the lids aren''t much help either. You can create a lot more room in your kitchen with a few adjustments. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5994361/this-diy-cabinet-door-knife-block-keeps-your-blades-at-the-ready">Add a knife block to a cabinet wall</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993792/build-an-affordable-custom-pantry-shelving-system-with-pipes?tag=diy">Building a pantry shelving system for cans and bottles with pipes</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5992389/build-a-space+saving-roll+out-pantry-that-fits-between-the-fridge-and-the-wall?tag=storage/kitchen">Create a roll-out pantry that fits between the fridge and the wall</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5988558/hang-dish-towels-on-clothespins-to-save-counter-space?tag=storage/kitchen">Hang dish towels on clothespins</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5983833/use-adhesive-hooks-to-organize-your-pot-lids-and-save-cabinet-space?tag=storage/kitchen">Use adhesive hooks to hang pot lids on cabinet walls</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5947879/magnetic-panels-turn-your-kitchen-walls-into-extra-storage-space?tag=storage/kitchen">Add magnetic panels to your wall to store cookware</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5955911/hacker-challenge-winner-drain-your-dishes-from-a-diy-hanging-rack?tag=storage/kitchen">Create a hanging drying rack for self-drying storage</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5936956/snowpeak-chopping-set-stores-your-knife-inside-the-cutting-board?tag=storage/kitchen">Store your knife in a cutting board</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5883662/maximize-kitchen-drawer-space-by-storing-utensils-diagonally?tag=storage/kitchen">Store kitchen utensils diagonally to maximize space</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5503462/diy-magnetic-spice-rack-doubles-your-shelf-space">Store items under your shelves, too</a></li></ul>\n<p>In most cases, kitchen storage hacks involve a better utilization of the space that you already have rather than creating more. Kitchens offer so much storage because cookware tends to have awkward, inefficient shapes. With some creative solutions, however, you can fit a lot more with little alteration.</p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>The Bedroom</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17l106lr6bb3ujpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>A bedroom doesn''t need much more than a bed and your clothing, but we like to make our rooms into more than a place to sleep. Collections, decorations, workspaces, entertainment centers, and more find their way into the bedroom to provide us with a room that''s good for more than just one thing. This, of course, often creates a storage problem. Fortunately, you can solve it by utilizing wasted and unused space:</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/storage/bedroom">Store extra sheets under your mattress</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5961912/hacker-challenge-winner-create-hidden-storage-in-your-bedroom">Make a bed with built-in storage</a> (or <a href="http://www.amazon.co%6D/gp/product/B001KW0BWO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004DEJ6XG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lifehackeramzn--20" target="_blank">buy one</a>)</li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5915312/diy-pegboard-headboard-adds-storage-to-tiny-bedrooms?tag=storage/bedroom">Add a pegboard headboard to your bed for extra storage</a> (although you may want to avoid this one if you''re in an earthquake zone)</li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5981662/how-can-i-turn-my-closet-into-an-office?tag=closet">Use your bedroom closet as an office space</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5878369/roll-your-towels-instead-of-folding-them-to-save-space-and-de+clutter-your-linen-closet?tag=closets">Save closet space by rolling your towels</a></li></ul>\n<p>You''ll find extra storage in your bedroom under your bed more than anywhere else, but don''t neglect your walls. You can always <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5835678/tapehooks-hang-your-desk-clutter-on-the-wall">put extra clutter on the wall</a>. Sometimes it even looks good.</p>\n<h3>The Living Room(s)</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="480" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18ixu1ax0gb1yjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>Your living room can serve many purposes. Perhaps it''s where you house your home theater setup, or maybe you it''s simply a place to sit and talk. Whatever the case may be, you can add quite a bit of storage in this room with a few hacks:</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5734999/float-ikea-bookcases-for-maximum-shelf-space-with-zero-footprint">Float your shelves on the wall for a little extra space</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5721203/diy-coffee-table-folds-into-a-dining-table">Combine your coffee table and dining table into one</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5444434/diy-folding-table-saves-space-doubles-as-picture-frame">Create a folding table that hangs on the wall and looks just like a picture frame</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5619746/how-to-build-a-hidden-home-theater-pc-inside-your-entertainment-center">Build your home theater into a console table</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5605834/diy-accessory+hiding-tv-panel">Hide your media center gear behind your wall-mounted television set</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/396516/diy-pegboard-media-center">Organize your media center equipment better with a pegboard</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5951358/diy-computer+in+a+coffee+table-takes-the-living-room-to-new-levels-of-awesome">Put a computer in your coffee table</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5954888/hack-your-coffee-table-to-have-a-lift+up-top">Give your coffee table storage and a lift-up top</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5940362/turn-a-coffee-table-into-an-awesome-two+player-arcade-cabinet">Put an arcade cabinet into your coffee table</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5950568/make-an-awesome-coffee-table-out-of-magazine-holders-and-a-stool">Make a storage stool out of magazine holders</a></li><li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5760624/wall+hanging-office-supplies-a-fun-use-of-a-small-workspace">Hang little items on the wall with planters</a></li></ul>\n<p>Ultimately, the goal with any room is to find traditionally unused space and find ways to shove your stuff in it. The more you can hide, the more you can keep without cluttering up your home. There''s a point when you just have to say it''s time to get rid of all this crap, but so long as you can find creative places to store it you won''t have to resort to a garage sale just yet.</p>\n<p>Happy Friday!</p>', '', '', '2013-04-13 12:00:00', '', 'weekendhacker', '5994459', '2013-05-18 18:59:54');

Ask your friends — someone may have a grinder you can borrow, or would be happy to grind them for you in exchange for some cookies or part of the bag of coffee.</p>\n<p>If you have a local coffee shop, talk to the barista (over the latte'' you just bought) and ask if he/she will grind your beans for you. I''ve heard even the mighty Starbucks will grind your beans for you if you ask nicely enough.</p>\n<p>If you want to do it yourself, you need to find a way to get the beans down to grinds. Some ideas:</p>\n<p><b>Mortar and pestle.</b> Be careful not to make Turkish coffee powder instead of the more chunky grinds you want.</p>\n<p><b>Rolling pin.</b> Put the beans in a heavy Ziploc bag or similar, and have a go at them. Roll, whack, smash.</p>\n<p>Have a nice, heavy frying pan? Ziploc bag again, <b>hammer</b> away.</p>\n<h4><a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/29031/8766" target="_blank">Chef Flambe Answers:</a></h4>\n<p>Methods mentioned above are all great quick fixes for your problem, however, as said before they''ll give you a poor grind and a poor cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is to go to your local coffee house, tell them your sad story and if you ask really nice they might grind it for you. But don''t go in on a busy Saturday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Another suggestion: <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/784116/gsi-outdoors-javagrind-coffee-grinder" target="_blank">REI</a> in the US and <a href="http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/HikingCamping/CookwareUtensils/PRD~5018-722/gsi-javagrind.jsp" target="_blank">MEC</a> in Canada sell some great handheld camping coffee bean grinders for around $20.

The taste of coffee relies on how the beans filter your water... faster or slower flow will <i>drastically</i> alter the taste.

These can be as minor as a tweak that allows you to change how the music app works to full blown apps that let you record your screen. With that in mind, here are a few of our favorites from the last few months. </p>\n<p>Since not much has changed in iOS over the years, jailbreakers have been actively pushing out all kinds of great tweaks and apps. You''ll need <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5771943/how-to-jailbreak-your-iphone-the-always-up+to+date-guide-[ios-61]">to jailbreak your phone</a> to use these, but the process is simple to do and only takes a few minutes.</p>\n<h3>QuickShoot Pro Adds Secretive Photo Snapping from Almost Anywhere</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="305" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kevvjqxp2mhjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p><a href="http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=quickshootproDp" target="_blank">QuickShoot Pro</a> (99¢) is very simple in premise, but surprisingly useful. Instead of tapping and launching the camera app to take a picture, you just need to double-tap an icon on the home screen and it instantly snaps a picture. That works on the camera grabber on the lock screen too. If video is more your thing, you can triple-tap any icon to start shooting. If you''re a fan of snapping quick photos without anyone noticing, QuickShoot Pro is a great addition to your library.</p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>MusicWidget Gives You Access to Your Currently Playing Song on the Home Screen</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="183" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kevwl8jincljpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p><a href="http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=musicwidgetDp" target="_blank">MusicWidget</a> (free) is especially handy if you listen to a lot of music on your iPhone. When you double-tap the Music app, MusicWidget opens up a small folder that allows you to pause and skip tracks. It''s simple, but it''s well done and saves you from having to either open up the music app or scroll over to the music controls in the multitasking bar.</p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>Pluck Adds a Music Picker to the Lock Screen</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="165" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kewqudlv1ogjpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p><a href="http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=62065" target="_blank">Pluck</a> (free) is a tweak that makes it so you can actually access your music library directly from the lock screen. When you double-tap the home button to pull up the music controls from the lock screen, Pluck adds a small button to the screen that gives you access to songs. From here, you can pick a new song, playlist, or artist without every unlocking your device.</p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>Protect Photos Locks Your Photos (and Any Other App) Away from Prying Eyes</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="182" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kew0jasru3ejpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>If you hand your phone over to people a lot, you might want to keep certain parts of your phone private. <a href="http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=protectphotosDp" target="_blank">Protect Photos</a> (free) is a simple little tweak that allows you to add password protection to any app—including the photo, camera, wallpaper settings, and just about anything else. It''s simple, but if you want to keep your iPhone a little more private it works great.</p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>WeatherIcon 6 Adds Current Weather to the Weather Icon</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="406" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kew1it9wzubjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>One of the best things in iOS is how the Calendar app icon auto-updates the date.

Unfortunately, the weather app doesn''t do the same thing. <a href="http://modmyi.com/cydia/package.php?id=61864" target="_blank">WeatherIcon 6</a> (free) is an older app recently updated for iOS 6 that adds the current weather to your Weather app icon (or any icon) so you always know what''s going on outside.</p>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>RecordMyScreen Records Everything You Do on Your Screen</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="148" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kew2gcrkol5jpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>Most of us don''t really need to record our iPhone screens, but occasionally it''s nice to do when you''re on a high score run in your favorite game you want to show off to friends or you''re making a how-to guide. <a href="http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=recordmyscreenDp" target="_blank">RecordMyScreen</a> (free) is an open source and free app that makes recording your screen incredibly simple.

Here Are Your Alternatives.', 'http://lifehacker.com/5994508/cable-companies-can-now-force-you-to-rent-set+top-boxes-here-are-your-alternatives', '<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18ken1rtv7yljjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">For many customers, cable may be getting even more expensive. A new FCC ruling lets cable providers require customers to rent set-top boxes for their basic tiers (including local stations). With HD boxes running around $10 a month <em>for each TV</em> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/us/26cable.html?_r=2&amp;ref=general&amp;src=me&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;" target="_blank">using more power than the fridge</a>, this might be the straw the breaks the cable subscriber''s back. Here are your other options. </p>\n<h3>The Issue: New Added Expenses for Those with Multiple TVs or PC Tuner Cards</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="465" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kepn20f56qujpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>For a long time, you needed a cable box to get higher-tiered cable channels, but if all you wanted was your local news in HD, you could plug the cable directly into your TV and call it a day—no box rental fees required for that TV set. Now cable operators can scramble those signals, thanks to the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/commission-relaxes-cable-encryption-prohibition" target="_blank">FCC''s recent ruling</a> (which is a change from an FCC rule in October that local TV channel signals had to be transmitted &quot;in the clear.&quot;)</p>\n<p>The scrambled signals mean that cable providers can require you to rent a set-top box or other equipment for each TV you own. It''s being pushed by the FCC and cable companies as &quot;a win for consumers&quot; with the explanation that this allows cable companies to easily activate or deactivate cable service without having to send the cable guy over.</p>\n<p>While it might be more convenient for the few times in your life you''ll need your service activated or deactivated, in reality, the biggest benefit will be for the cable companies.</p>\n<p>As <a href="http://www.consumerworld.org/pages/rcnscramble.htm" target="_blank">Consumer World reports</a>, the first cable company to take advantage of this rule is RCN, a small provider on the east coast. After RCN scrambled local basic TV channels, customers without a cable box found them all inoperative. As part of the new FCC ruling, cable providers have to give customers one or two free devices to decrypt the new signals. However, this provision only lasts for up to two years (depending on customer''s level of service), if you have more than one or two televisions you''ll probably have to pay for other boxes, and the free boxes don''t have to be high-def ones. So RCN offers a standard definition box, but those who want HD will need to rent a box for $10 a month on each television.</p>\n<p>RCN is a small cable operator, but Consumer World says that Comcast is expected to encrypt its basic channels as well. Most people with higher cable tiers already have cable boxes, but if you have a basic plan for the local channels, your university or apartment complex offers local cable channels, or have a screen connected directly to the cable and not a set-top box (like a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5632722/how-to-pick-the-right-tv-tuner-for-your-diy-dvr">computer with a TV tuner</a>), this is an extra monthly cost you don''t need. Basic cable is already about $25 (at least in my area) before taxes; with the HD box rental, that''s like a 30% price hike for each TV set.</p>\n<p>So here are some options, particularly if you only want basic, local channels in high definition.</p>\n<h3>Indoor Antennas: Over-the-Air Channels in HD for a One-Time Fee</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="159" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kenwqmb1fmejpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>For about a one-time investment (about $35), you can watch network television in high-definition with no monthly fees.

With Hulu, you can watch shows from current seasons, but you might have to wait as much as eight days after new episodes air before watching them, depending on the network. Hulu Plus, for $8 a month, gives you access to previous seasons, but it''s also still ad-supported. Netflix doesn''t stream current seasons at all.</p>\n<p>You could also buy individual shows'' latest TV episodes on Amazon Prime, but for $2.99 for HD (or $1.99 regular) each, it''s probably not cost-effective if you want to keep up with your favorite shows.</p>\n<p>None of these services offer all shows on all broadcast stations, but depending on what you like to watch and your patience, they could fill in the void for you when you cut the cable cord. (Note: If you don''t have a &quot;smart&quot; internet-connected television, you''ll also need some way to stream to your TV, such as <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5946193/how-to-find-the-best-tv-set-top-box-and-ditch-cable-once-and-for-all">a set-top box like the Roku or Apple TV</a>, your own <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5936546/how-i-built-the-media-center-of-my-dreams-for-under-500">home theater PC</a>, or a way to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5811209/how-to-connect-your-computer-to-your-tv-for-beginners">connect your computer to your TV</a>.)</p>\n<h3>Aereo: Local Broadcast Channels with No Cables or Cords, Currently Only in New York</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="175" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kenwqmd0pv5png/ku-medium.png" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p><a href="https://aereo.com" target="_blank">Aereo</a> is a groundbreaking service that streams live broadcast TV and more than 20 other channels in HD online, with no set-top boxes, antennas, or other devices required. It even has a DVR feature. The downside is this service is only available in the Metro New York area (including Long Island and New Jersey). Plus, as you might expect, cable companies and broadcast stations (which collect retransmission fees from cable and satellite operators) are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/business/media/aereo-has-tv-networks-circling-the-wagons.html?_r=0" target="_blank">in an uproar about this</a>. (Fox and CBS, in fact, are <a href="http://www.techspot.com/news/52204-aereo-internet-tv-forces-fox-cbs-to-consider-subscription-based-model.html" target="_blank">considering switching to a subscription-only model</a> as a result.)</p>\n<p>If you''re in the New York City area, Aereo has a <a href="http://aereo.com/try" target="_blank">Try for Free plan</a> that gives you access for up to an hour a day of live broadcast TV. Its other plans are really affordable, compared to cable. The 24-hour day pass offers 3 hours of DVR space and the ability to record two shows at once (and watch them for up to 10 days later), for $1/day plus tax, and higher plans starting at $8/month for unlimited live local TV viewing and 20 hours of DVR space. The service works on all the major browsers, iOS devices, AirPlay, and Roku.</p>\n<p>I''m watching the latest episode of Glee live as I write this, and it looks and streams well.

(170, 6, 'How to Escape the Cult of "Busy"', 'http://lifehacker.com/5994072/how-to-escape-the-cult-of-busy', '<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kc6oibti2f6jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">People who often say they''re &quot;too busy&quot; or &quot;crazy busy&quot; sound like buzzing busy signals. And when you start sounding like an appliance, it makes it hard to connect with you. </p>\n<p>My reaction to your busy signal is much like that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling" target="_blank">Mindy Kaling</a>, who sees stress as non-conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No one ever wants to hear how stressed out anyone else is, because most of the time everyone is stressed out. Going on and on in detail about how stressed out I am isn''t conversation. It''ll never lead anywhere. No one is going to say, &quot;Wow, Mindy, you really have it especially bad. I have heard some stories of stress, but this just takes the cake.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, going on about how busy you are isn''t conversation and doesn''t lead anywhere—except making your conversation partner bored, or worse, peeved. People who act super busy send the same message, making time spent with them never feel quite whole. Interestingly, I find that most people who are legitimately occupied - with their work, or family, or art, or what-have-you—rarely play the &quot;too busy&quot; card, or go out of their way to make time for meaningful connection exactly because they''ve been busy.</p>\n<h3>The Meaning Behind &quot;Busy&quot;</h3>\n<p>When you go on to other people, or to yourself, about being so busy, you''re often engaging in doublespeak. Let''s dig a little deeper to translate what you actually mean when you get in the habit of saying or acting like you''re too busy:</p>\n<p><strong>I matter.</strong> Being busy means I''m needed and significant in this great big universe. Though going around literally telling people, &quot;I matter!&quot; and expecting some sort of substantive conversation to result would be really weird, I''ll just say &quot;I''m busy!&quot; instead.</p>\n<p><strong>I am super-important.</strong> Doling out complaints and explanations about being too busy is the express line to a mini-ego trip. It''s going beyond &quot;I matter&quot; to &quot;I matter … more than you&quot; despite the fact that nobody ever wants to hear this.</p>\n<p><strong>I''m giving you an easy excuse.</strong> This is one of the easiest outs for stuff I don''t want to do. Alternatively, I''ve spent a lot of time being distracted or stuck, but this excuse allows me to feel okay with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I''m afraid.</strong> I keep relentlessly busy because I suffer from FOMO, or fear of missing out. I''m scared that I don''t matter, that I''m not important, that I''m not needed, so I''m going to spend my time on distracting stuff that doesn''t really matter, that''s not all that important, where I''m not actually needed.</p>\n<p><strong>I feel guilty.</strong> There''s fulfilling, meaningful stuff that I actually do want to do but I can rationalize it away instead of confronting challenges or changing direction. Alternatively, I think being busy is such a valuable quality that I''ll overbook myself to the point where I feel guilty for not getting to everything or for spending time on anything that doesn''t fit into a limited definition of &quot;productive.&quot;</p>\n<p>The worship of busy-ness as such a virtue is where the trouble begins, providing the foundation to its indiscriminate use as a front or an excuse. It''s easy, even enticing, to neglect the importance of filling our time with meaning, thinking instead that we''ll be content with merely filling our time. We self-impose these measures of self-worth by looking at quantity instead of quality of activity.</p>\n<h3>Break Free</h3>\n<p>In the children''s book (that every adult should read), <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>, the protagonist Milo comes across the frightening, faceless Terrible Trivium, a &quot;demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs, ogre of wasted effort, and monster of habit.&quot; Milo and his friends fall under his spell, agreeing to perform busy-work like moving a huge pile of sand from one place to another, grain by grain, using a tweezer. The Terrible Trivium''s explanation for this terrible fate?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you only do the easy and useless jobs, you''ll never have to worry about the important ones which are so difficult. You just won''t have the time. For there''s always something to do to keep you from what you really should be doing….</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What a scary thought! So if you find yourself feeling frazzled, habitually explaining away things with a busy status, it''s probably time to slow down and pay attention to the important, difficult stuff. Examine what is keeping you so busy compared to what you really should and want to be doing.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple ways to start:</p>\n<p><strong>Track yo'' self.</strong> In the quest to better connect your attention and action, do an attention audit. Track your time using a tool like <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/" target="_blank">Harvest</a> or a <a href="http://lauravanderkam.com/books/168-hours/manage-your-time/" target="_blank">time log</a> spreadsheet. Break down how you spend time on the computer with <a href="http://rescuetime.com/" target="_blank">RescueTime</a>. Or see how you answer the questions of &quot;What did you get done today?&quot; and &quot;What did you pay attention to today?&quot; over time using <a href="http://www.idonethis.com/" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Change your language.</strong> We like this tip from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203358704577237603853394654.html" target="_blank">Laura Vanderkam</a>. Instead of putting things in terms of time and activity, frame them in terms of priority:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instead of saying &quot;I don''t have time&quot; try saying &quot;it''s not a priority,&quot; and see how that feels. Often, that''s a perfectly adequate explanation. I have time to iron my sheets, I just don''t want to. But other things are harder. Try it: &quot;I''m not going to edit your résumé, sweetie, because it''s not a priority.&quot; &quot;I don''t go to the doctor because my health is not a priority.&quot; If these phrases don''t sit well, that''s the point. Changing our language reminds us that time is a choice. If we don''t like how we''re spending an hour, we can choose differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another thing you can do is once you have a clearer handle of your priorities and how you want to spend your energy, change your definition of &quot;productivity&quot; to encompass those things.</p>\n<p><strong>Press pause.</strong> Not only do we need to <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/post/33892676864/the-science-behind-why-better-energy-management-is-the" target="_blank">rest and renew</a>, we also have to <a href="http://blog.jackcheng.com/post/25160553986/the-slow-web" target="_blank">slow</a> down and pause to acknowledge our feelings, celebrate our accomplishments, and gain some insight. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/exhaustion-is-not-a-status-symbol/2012/10/02/19d27aa8-0cba-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_print.html" target="_blank">Brené Brown</a> explains how people stay busy out of habit and fear. She recommends letting go of &quot;exhaustion as a status symbol and productivity as self-worth&quot; and allowing us to explore what matters:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[W]hen we make the transition from crazy-busy to rest, we have to find out what comforts us, what really refuels us, and do that. We deserve to not just put work away and be in service of someone else. What''s really meaningful for us? What do we want to be doing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do less and feel more joy.</strong> The opposite of the fear of missing out, as Anil Dash so beautifully wrote, is the <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/07/jomo.html" target="_blank">joy of missing out</a>. Pay attention to what''s in front of you, and you''ll gain control and find joy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Being the one in control of what moves me, what I feel obligated by, and what attachments I have to fleeting experiences is not an authority that I''m willing to concede to the arbitrary whims of an app on my mobile phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Feel more joy. Learn how to do less. Stop spreading yourself so thin by saying &quot;no&quot; more, by saying &quot;no&quot; to being busy, and by meaning &quot;yes&quot; more fully.</p>\n<p class="arrow"><a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/post/45912361388/busyness-not-virtue" target="_blank">Busyness is Not a Virtue</a> | iDoneThis</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><i style="font-size:80%">Janet Choi is the Chief Creative Officer at <a href="http://idonethis.com/" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a>, the easiest way to get more of the right stuff done.

Here''s what we tackled this week.</p>\n<ul><li><b>Why does YouTube prevent video downloading? If we want to watch offline, what are our options?</b> YouTube pays its content publishers with ad revenue and those ads aren''t available offline, therefore YouTube doesn''t offer downloadable content to be played offline. At some point in the future they would like to be able to offer the same experience without internet connectivity, but right now you have to remain online to watch your YouTube videos.</li><li><b>A lot of our readers run into copyright issues on YouTube for a couple of reasons. Sometimes they upload content that''s incorrectly marked as copyrighted. Other times they have a clip from their favorite childhood television show, for example, that just isn''t available anywhere else online. The latter is, in probably every case, a clear legal violation. The former is not. Nevertheless, YouTube is very aggressive when it comes to weeding out copyright violations, to the point that non-violators (and, possibly, people doing harmless things) get punished as a result. What is YouTube''s official position on this problem, are there any plans to improve the way things work for the user, and what do you suggest users do if they''re falsely accused of copyright infringement and their video is removed?</b> If you posted a copyrighted video, sorry, that''s against YouTube policy. Even if it''s just a little clip, if it gets removed you''re technology infringing and you don''t have any right to get it back. If your video was removed by accident, you can submit a claim to your rights using <a href="http://youtube.com/yt/copyright/" target="_blank">YouTube''s copyright tools</a>. It''s actually really straightforward.</li><li><b>Is there any way to prevent myself from accessing porn on my Android phone without resorting to a specific browser that filters out pages?</b> Yes, get a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=parental+controls&amp;c=apps" target="_blank">parental control app</a> for your phone and block adult web sites. If you change your mind and want a dedicated browser, however, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudacl&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5jbG91ZGFjbCJd" target="_blank">Safe Browser</a> should do the trick.</li></ul>\n<h3>Tips of the Week</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="300" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17fitcphifrmpjpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p>This week''s tips are all about YouTube. Our guest and YouTube product manager Trevor O''Brien shared some cool things you can do on YouTube with search:</p>\n<ul><li><b>Filter YouTube searches by timeframe and channel</b>: Let''s say you want to find videos on Obama''s new budget for 2014. You could search for &quot;obama budget&quot; but then you''d get videos from various timeframes. After performing that search, click the Filters button underneath the search box and you''ll be able to specify how recent you want the videos to be. If you only want videos directly from the White House, you can search for &quot;obama budget @whitehouse&quot; instead. When you use the @ symbol and add the name of a channel, you''ll only get videos from that channel.</li><li><b>Search for synonyms of a word</b>: Sometimes you''re looking for how to videos on, say, guitar lessons but someone might have named their video &quot;guitar tutorial&quot; and you want to view that as well. Instead of searching for &quot;guitar lesson,&quot; search for &quot;guitar ~lesson&quot; to get synonyms of the word lesson. When you add a ~, YouTube knows to look for synonyms on not just the word itself.</li><li><b>Find creative commons videos that you can use in remixes and mashups</b>: Perform a Google search for any video, then click filters and select Creative Commons under the Features header. This will only show you videos you can use in mashups, or however else you like.</li><li><b>View closed captions in multiple languages</b>: Many YouTube videos have closed captions built right in. You''ve probably seen this before, but what you may not have noticed is that you can get them in several languages. This is really great if you want to watch a video not in your language. If you need to find YouTube videos that support captions, just search for what you want and click the Filter button under the search box to select the close caption option. This will tell YouTube to only display results that include a caption track.</li></ul>\n<h3>Downloads of the Week</h3>\n<ul><li><b>Thorin''s Pick</b>: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5991266">BluTrol</a> (iOS, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5771943/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-jailbreaking-your-iphone-ipod-touch-and-ipad">Jailbroken</a>)</li><li><b>Whitson''s Pick</b>: <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5837543">EaseUS Todo Backup</a> (Windows)</li><li><b>Dachis'' Pick</b>: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textscrub/id600842582?mt=12" target="_blank">TextScrub</a> (OS X) and <a href="http://www.clipboardfusion.com/" target="_blank">Text Scrubber</a> (Windows)</li></ul>\n<associate></associate>\n<h3>How Do I Submit a Question?</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="207" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17fiud3lvy578jpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p>There are two ways to send in your question:</p>\n<ul><li>Call (347) 687-8109 and record a question. <b>Calls are awesome!

(172, 6, 'How to Handle a Micromanaging Boss', 'http://lifehacker.com/5994065/how-to-handle-a-micromanaging-boss', '<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kby5d6sdb3ujpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">Every morning when I arrived at my office, I used to <a href="http://www.thedailymuse.com/career/how-to-get-more-done-the-1-3-5-rule/" target="_blank">find a to-do list</a> printed out and neatly laid on my keyboard, courtesy of my boss. But this wasn''t a typical bulleted list—it was a long (upwards of three pages), drawn-out document, where each bullet point was accompanied by paragraphs of elaboration, laying out to the very smallest of details exactly how I should accomplish the task. </p>\n<p>And as I stared at this book (er, document), wondering if it would somehow look less menacing after my morning coffee, I couldn''t help but think, <em>Wouldn''t it have taken her less time to just complete the things on the list?</em> And the micromanaging didn''t stop there—she constantly asked for updates on my progress, added to and modified the list, and ultimately refused to let me do my job on my terms.</p>\n<p>For a while, I thought it was impossible to change my boss''s overbearing ways <a href="http://www.thedailymuse.com/career/giving-feedback-to-your-boss-like-a-boss/" target="_blank">without completely offending her</a> (and risking my job!). But over time, I did. And luckily, there are several ways you can show your boss that you''re in control—and loosen her grip a little bit, too.</p>\n<h3>Eliminate Any Possibility That She Needs to Micromanage</h3>\n<p>Once I''d experienced my boss'' micromanaging for a few weeks, I assumed there wasn''t anything I could do but succumb to it. Since I knew she was going to remind me about my deadlines and check on my progress multiple times a day, I figured there was no reason for me to duplicate her efforts. And while my work was still getting done on time (<a href="http://www.thedailymuse.com/career/email-overhaul-how-to-write-messages-that-actually-get-read/" target="_blank">I couldn''t really ignore all those emails titled &quot;Urgent!&quot;</a>), I was probably sending her the message that I couldn''t manage my workload without her so-called &quot;help.&quot;</p>\n<p>So, first things first: Take a hard look at your recent attitude, productivity, and track record to make sure that you aren''t doing anything to solicit such nitpicking. Are you unintentionally (or intentionally) letting your work slip through the cracks? <a href="http://www.thedailymuse.com/career/the-bad-habit-thats-killing-your-work-reputation/" target="_blank">Do you show up late</a>? Miss deadlines? In this case, of course she''s going to try to manage every detail—because she''s worried that you can''t.</p>\n<h3>Anticipate What She Wants—and Act</h3>\n<p>A lot of the tasks my boss assigned me (and constantly reminded me about) were tasks I knew I was supposed to do—she just wanted to make <em>extra</em> sure that I had them on my radar. It was incredibly frustrating when she''d walk into my office to say, &quot;Hey, I just wanted to remind you that we need to get the weekly schedule emailed out today,&quot; when I was already well aware of the assignment. (Seriously, I did it every week.)</p>\n<p>So, a great start to halting micromanagement in its tracks is to anticipate the tasks that your manager expects and get them done well ahead of time.

At my current (and much more corporate) job, I wouldn''t feel nearly as comfortable confronting my boss about such an issue. However, there are small—and respectful—ways you can express your opinion. For example, ask your boss for the opportunity to complete a small project on your own from start to finish, with the understanding that afterward, you''ll discuss what you did well and what you can improve upon next time. Pose it this way: It''ll be a great learning opportunity and a chance for your boss to evaluate your work methods.

Within your stacks of documents, though, are ones you probably should hold onto for many more years—and make a digital copy of for extra backup. However, most of the papers in your overflowing filing can be confidently recycled or shredded. Here''s the lowdown on the lifespan of various types of important-sounding documents, so you can sort them out and do some paper clutter spring cleaning.</p>\n<p>Note: Opinions vary on the exact dates for retaining records, but these are some basic guidelines from various professional sources that can help you trim your bulging file cabinet.</p>\n<h3>Documents to Keep ‘Til the End of Time</h3>\n<p>The documents you should never get rid of are all fairly obvious: They''re official papers from government agencies, typically involve lawyers, will be very important to your loved ones if you pass away, related to something of significant value, and/or are a pain to replace. As we noted in our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5977082/what-documents-should-i-shred-and-what-should-i-keep">what to keep and what to shred guide</a>, these include:</p>\n<ul><li>Birth and death certificates</li><li>Social security cards</li><li>Pension plan documents</li><li>ID cards and passports</li><li>Marriage license</li><li>Business license</li><li>Military discharge papers</li><li>Any insurance policy</li><li>Wills, living wills, and powers of attorney (because <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5992722/one-day-youre-going-to-die-heres-how-to-prepare-for-it">we''re all going to die one day and need to prepare for it</a>)</li><li>Vehicle titles</li><li>Loan documents</li><li>House deeds and mortgage documents</li></ul>\n<p>Additionally, CPA Mark O.

In those cases, keep the receipts with the product manual until the warranty expires or with your tax papers.</li><li>Bank deposit or withdrawal slips: After you reconcile with your monthly statement</li><li>Credit card and bank statements: 7 years if you need them for tax support, otherwise one year.</li><li>Annual investment statements: Until you sell the investments, then hold them for 7 years after you sell with your tax papers.</li><li>Paycheck stubs: After reconciling with your W-2 form and have paid your taxes</li><li>Health explanation of benefits: 1 year</li><li>Utility records: At least 3 years, according to NY State Department of Consumer Protection</li><li>Taxes and supporting records (e.g., tax-related medical bills, donations, etc): The common recommendation is 7 years, because that''s how far back the IRS usually goes if you''re audited. The IRS has <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/How-long-should-I-keep-records%3F" target="_blank">more specific guidelines</a>, with advice varying from 3 years to indefinitely in cases for fraudulent returns).</li></ul>\n<h3>How Long to Keep Business Records</h3>\n<p>Finally, if you own your own business or are freelancing, your record retention needs will be more involved.

Here''s how it works, and how you can opt out. </p>\n<p>For most people, Facebook''s advertising system is insider-baseball that doesn''t really affect how we use the service. But as the targeted ads—the advertisements that take the data you provide to offer ads specific to you—get more accurate and start pulling in information from other sources (including the stuff you do <em>offline</em>), it''s more important than ever to understand their system. To figure out how this all works, I spoke with Elisabeth Diana, manager of corporate communication at Facebook. Let''s kick it off with the basics of how the targeted ads work online before moving on to some of the changes we''ll see with the recent inclusion of offline shopping data.</p>\n<h3>How Facebook Uses Your Profile to Target Ads</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="334" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kb1j9uhk6adjpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p>We''ve talked before about <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5987248/how-facebook-is-using-you-to-annoy-your-friends-and-how-to-stop-it">how Facebook uses you to annoy your friends</a> by turning your likes into subtle ads. This method of sponsored posts is deceptively simple.</p>\n<p>The most obvious example of a targeted ad uses something you like—say Target—and then shows an ad on the right side or in the newsfeed that simply says, &quot;[Name] likes Target.&quot; What you and your friends like helps determine what everyone on your friends list sees for ads. Any ad you click on then increases the likelihood of another similar ad.</p>\n<p>It''s not just what you and your friends are doing that generates ads though; it''s also basic demographic information. Diana notes that this also includes &quot;major life events like getting engaged or married.&quot; So, if you''re recently engaged and note that on Facebook, you''ll see ads about things like wedding planning.</p>\n<p>When an advertiser <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/connect" target="_blank">creates an ad on Facebook</a>, they can select all sorts of parameters so they reach the right people. A simple example of a parameter would be: &quot;Someone engaged to be married, who lives in New York, between the ages of 20-30.&quot; That''s simple, but advertisers can actually narrow that down to insane specifics, like &quot;Someone engaged to be married, who lives in New York, between the ages of 20-30, who likes swimming, and who drives a BMW.&quot; If your profile fits those parameters, you''ll likely see the ad. If you want to see how it works, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/create/" target="_blank">you can even try your hand at creating an ad</a>.</p>\n<p>It boils down to this: the more information you put about yourself on Facebook—where you live, your age, where (and if) you graduated college, the companies, brands, and activities you like, and even where you work—determines what kind of ads you''ll see. In theory, it makes it so targeted ads are more relevant to you.</p>\n<h4 class="modfont"><b>What Happens When You Don''t Like or Share Anything</b></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="252" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kay6t0r51l6jpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p>The way Facebook targets ads is based a lot around the information you provide. Using your likes, location, or age, Facebook puts you in a demographic and advertises to you. But what happens when you don''t include any of that information on your profile? It turns out that your friends are used to fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p>Chances are, even a barebones profile has a few bits of information about you. You probably at least have where you live and your age. That combined with the information your friends provide creates a reasonable demographic that advertisers can still reach you at. The ads won''t be as spookily accurate to you as if you provide a lot of data, but they''ll at least be about as accurate as a television ad on your favorite show.</p>\n<h4 class="modfont"><b>How to Keep Facebook from Targeting Ads Online</b></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="158" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaxdz6hh1iojpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>We know <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5843969/facebook-is-tracking-your-every-move-on-the-web-heres-how-to-stop-it">Facebook has an idea of what you''re doing online</a>. That can be unsettling if you''re concerned about your privacy and you don''t want your online habits contributing to advertisements, or if you don''t like the idea of Facebook collecting data about you that you''re not willfully providing. You''ll &quot;miss out&quot; on targeted ads, but here here are a few tools to keep that from happening online:</p>\n<ul><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-disconnect/ejpepffjfmamnambagiibghpglaidiec" target="_blank">Facebook Disconnect for Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/fbdc/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>: Facebook gets notified when you visit a page that uses Facebook Connect (the little &quot;Like&quot; button you find on most web sites, including ours), and that data can be used to target ads. Facebook Disconnect stops that flow of data.</li><li><a href="http://www.squirrelconspiracy.net/abp/facebook-privacy-list.html" target="_blank">Facebook Privacy List for Adblock Plus</a>: This subscription for <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/chrome" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a> blocks Facebook plugins and scripts from running all over the web so your browsing data doesn''t get tied to your Facebook account.</li><li><a href="http://www.abine.com/dntdetail.php" target="_blank">DoNotTrackMe</a>: DoNotTrackMe is another extension that blocks trackers and anyone who wants to collect your browsing data to create targeted ads.</li></ul>\n<p>Finally, you want to opt out of the Facebook Ads that use your actions (liking a page, sharing pages, etc) to promote ads to your friends:</p>\n<ol><li>Click the lock icon when you''re logged into Facebook and select &quot;see more settings&quot;.</li><li>Click the &quot;Ads&quot; tab on the sidebar.</li><li>Click &quot;Edit&quot; under &quot;Third Party Sites&quot; and change the setting to &quot;No one.&quot;</li><li>Click &quot;Edit&quot; under &quot;Ads &amp; Friends&quot; and select &quot;No One.&quot; This disables <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank">Social Ads</a>.</li></ol>\n<p>So, that takes care of the online advertising. Be sure to check out <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5813990/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-managing-your-facebook-privacy">our guide to Facebook privacy</a> for more information about all that. You can also <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5980029/how-to-hide-embarrassing-facebook-likes-from-your-profile">hide your likes from your profile</a> so they''re not as prominant. If you don''t actually mind the advertising, but want to improve the ads shown to you, you can always click the &quot;X&quot; next to any ad to get rid of it.</p>\n<h3>How Facebook Uses Your Real World Shopping to Target Ads</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="200" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaxsxtxbsavjpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>Of course, you probably knew about a lot of that already. Using information in Facebook profile to target ads is old news, but with a few <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-partner-acxiom-epsilon-match-store-purchases-user-profiles/239967/" target="_blank">recent partnerships</a>, Facebook is also going to use what you buy in real life stores to influence and track the ads you see. It sounds spooky, but it''s also older than you may realize.</p>\n<p>To do this, Facebook is combining the information they have with information from data collection companies like <a href="http://www.datalogix.com/" target="_blank">Datalogix</a>, <a href="http://www.acxiom.com/" target="_blank">Acxiom</a>, <a href="http://www.epsilon.com/" target="_blank">Epsilon</a>, and <a href="http://www.bluekai.com/" target="_blank">BlueKai</a>. These companies already collect information about you through things like store loyalty cards, mailing lists, public records information (including home or car ownership), browser cookies, and more. For example, if you buy a bunch of detergent at Safeway, and use your Safeway card to get a discount, that information is cataloged and saved by a company like Datalogix.</p>\n<p>How much do these data collecting companies know? According <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html" target="_blank">to The New York Times</a>: way more than you''d think, including race, gender, economic status, buying habits, and more. Typically, they then sell this data to advertisers or corporations, but when it''s combined with your information from Facebook, they get an even better idea of what you like, where you shop, and what you buy. As Diana describes it, Facebook is &quot;trying to give advertisers a chance to reach people both on and off Facebook,&quot; and make advertisements more relevant to you. <i style="font-size:80%">Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joelogon/2819512729/" target="_blank">Joe Loong</a></i>.</p>\n<h4 class="modfont"><b>How Real-Life Ad Targetting Works</b></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/1805291clxcxojpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p>The most shocking thing you''re going to find on Facebook is when something you do in the real world—say, buy a car, go shopping with a loyalty card at a grocery store, or sign up for an email list—actually impacts the ads you see. This is no different than any other direct marketing campaign like junk mail, but seeing it on Facebook might be a little unsettling at first. There are a couple reasons this might happen: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/459892990722543/" target="_blank">custom audiences</a>, and the recent partnerships with data collection companies we talked about earlier.</p>\n<p>Custom audiences are very simple and it basically allows an advertiser to upload an email list and compare that data (privately) with who''s on Facebook. Diana offered the simple example of buying a car. Let''s say you purchase a car from a dealership, and when you do so, you give them your email address. That dealership wants to advertise on Facebook, so they upload a list of all the email addresses they have. That data is then made private, and Facebook pairs the email address with the one you registered on Facebook. If they match, you might see an ad from that dealership on Facebook for a discounted tune-up or something similar. Additionally, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/164749007013531/" target="_blank">Lookalike audiences</a> might be used to advertise to people similar to you because you purchased a car there. That might mean your friends (assuming you''re all similar) will see the same ad from the dealership.</p>\n<p>The custom audiences can be used by any company advertising on Facebook. So, if you''re on your dentist''s email list, or that small bakery around the corner snagged your email for a free slice of pie, they can potentially reach you through this system.</p>\n<p>The partnership with other data collection agencies like Acxiom and Datalogix is going to look a little different. This means that when you use something like a customer loyalty card at a grocery store, you might see a targeted ad that reflects that. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/technology/facebook-expands-targeted-advertising-through-outside-data-sources.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">offers this example</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the very least, said Ms. Williamson, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, consumers will be &quot;forced to become more aware of the data trail they leave behind them and how companies are putting all that data together in new ways to reach them.&quot; She knows, for instance, that if she uses her supermarket loyalty card to buy cornflakes, she can expect to see a cornflakes advertisement when she logs in to Facebook.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A new targeting feature, <a href="http://www.facebook-studio.com/news/item/partner-categories-a-new-self-serve-targeting-feature" target="_blank">Partner categories</a>, takes the data collected by these third-party data brokers and puts you into a group. So, if you''re in a group of people who buys a lot of frozen pizza at Safeway, you''ll see ads for frozen pizza, and maybe other frozen foods.</p>\n<p>It sounds a little weird at a glance, but it''s important to remember that this is all information that you''re already providing. Facebook is using data collected by outside companies to create a more accurate portrayal of you so marketers can advertise to you directly.</p>\n<h4 class="modfont"><b>How Your Data Is Kept Private</b></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="230" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaxhbj68fejjpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p>All of this information being exchanged should make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up a little. If anything goes wrong, it could leak a bunch of your private information all over the place. Or, at the very least, marketers would get a lot more information about you then you want like your username, email, and location data. To keep your information private, Facebook uses a system called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="_blank">hashing</a>.</p>\n<p>First, your personal information like email and name is encrypted. So, your name, login info, and anything else that would identify you as a person goes away. Then, Facebook turns the rest of the information into a series of numbers and letters using hashing. For example, Age: 31, Likes: Lifehacker, Swimming, BMW''s, Location: New York, turns into something like, &quot;342asafk43255adjk.&quot; Finally, this information is combined with what the data collection companies have on you to create a better picture of your shopping habits so they can target ads. Slate <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/03/facebook_advertisement_studies_their_ads_are_more_like_tv_ads_than_google.single.html" target="_blank">describes the system like so</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What they came up with was a Rube Goldbergian system that strips out personally identifiable information from the databases at Facebook, Datalogix, and the major retailers while still matching people and their purchases. The system works by creating three separate data sets. First, Datalogix &quot;hashes&quot; its database—that is, it turns the names, addresses and other personally identifiable data for each person in its logs into long strings of numbers. Facebook and retailers do the same thing to their data. Then, Datalogix compares its hashed data with Facebook''s to find matches. Each match indicates a potential test subject-someone on Facebook who is also part of Datalogix''s database. Datalogix runs a similar process with retailers'' transaction data. At the end of it all, Datalogix can compare the Facebook data and the retail data, but, importantly, none of the databases will include any personally identifiable data—so Facebook will never find out whether and when you, personally, purchased Tide, and Procter &amp; Gamble and Kroger will never find out your Facebook profile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the actual advertisers point of view, the flow of information doesn''t reveal personal details. It just tells them how many potential customers might see an ad. &quot;An advertiser would learn something like, ''about 50% of your customers are on Facebook,''&quot; says Diana, &quot;But they don''t know who you are.&quot; <i style="font-size:80%">Image by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg" target="_blank">Jorge Stolfi</a></i>.</p>\n<h4 class="modfont"><b>How to Opt Out of Offline Targetting</b></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="163" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaxozrl58fpjpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>Unlike the internal advertising system that uses the information you already provide to Facebook to give you ads, these new partnerships with real world data collection agencies go way beyond that. Now, they''re able to see what you''re buying at stores offline, and that''s disconcerting for a lot of people. The goal, of course, is more relevant ads, but that comes at the price of privacy and security. With all this data out there, it would be easy to get a very clear image of who you are, where you live, what you like, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp" target="_blank">even if you''re pregnant</a>. Thankfully, opting out of the data collection companies also gets you out of the integration with Facebook (and everywhere else).</p>\n<p>This process is a lot more complicated than it should be, but the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/howto-opt-out-databrokers-showing-your-targeted-advertisements-facebook" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation has a step-by-step guide</a> for each of the data brokers. Basically, you''ll need to opt out in three different places: <a href="https://isapps.acxiom.com/optout/optout.aspx" target="_blank">Acxiom</a>, <a href="https://www.datalogix.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Datalogix</a>, and <a href="http://www.epsilon.com/consumer-preference-center" target="_blank">Epsilon</a> in order to ensure your shopping data in the real world isn''t used on Facebook (and beyond). BlueKai, unfortunately, has no direct way to opt out so you''ll need to use the browser extensions listed in the first section.</p>\n<p>If you really want to keep those loyalty cards from tracking you, just <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5819065/get-grocery-store-discounts-without-providing-personal-information-by-using-jennys-number">use Jenny''s number</a> (867-5309) at the checkout lane instead of setting up an account.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Those are the basics of how Facebook''s various targeted advertising systems work. Of course, a lot of complex math and algorithms are in place to actually generate this data, but it really boils down to how much information you''re making public—whether you''re aware of it or not—that makes the system tick. If you like the targeted ads, they should improve even more as the years go on. If you don''t, opting out is always an option.</p>', '', '', '2013-04-11 03:00:00', '', 'facebook', '5994380', '2013-05-18 18:59:54');

The question comes packaged in various different guises—whether it is a beginner dipping their toes in the freelancing waters for the first time or someone who has been freelancing for a while but wants to renegotiate their rate with a client. </p>\n<p>Setting and negotiating rates can seem like one of the most complicated and intimidating parts of freelancing but it really doesn''t have to be. Today I''m going to give you an in-depth overview of how to set and negotiate rates with prospective and existing clients. Although I''m a freelance writer, I believe that most of the following advice applies to any service-based business.</p>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="427" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaf2h3f3nz8jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>\n<h3>Your Minimum Acceptable Rate (MAR)</h3>\n<p>The first thing you must do as a freelancer is ascertain the lowest equivalent hourly rate you are willing to work for—your Minimum Acceptable Rate (MAR). If you''re already a full-time freelancer (or are planning on being one), your MAR calculation should look something like this:</p>\n<p><strong>( (personal overheads + business overheads) / hours worked ) + tax</strong></p>\n<p>Let''s look at a practical example. Say your personal overheads (i.e. the total cost of keeping a roof over your head, food on your plate, and so on) are $30,000 p.a., and your business overheads are a projected $5,000 p.a. You plan on doing client work for 6 hours a day for 48 weeks of the year (1,440 hours total). Here''s the calculation for your MAR (gross of tax):</p>\n<p>($30,000 + $5,000) / 1,440</p>\n<p>Your MAR (gross of tax) is $24.31. Add say 20% for tax, and your MAR (net of tax) is $29.17.</p>\n<p>If the above calculation seems a little rough, that''s because it is. Don''t concern yourself with trying to set a precise MAR, because there are far too many variables at play to perfect it anyway. Using the above calculation does the job well enough, as long as you err on the side of conservatism.</p>\n<p>Another way to calculate your MAR is to take your previous (or current) salary and divide it by the number of hours you plan on working. The addition of overheads should be covered by the reduction in tax from being self-employed, but you may want to confirm this for yourself. I am not a fan of this approach—you will probably be underselling yourself wildly. Freelancers should earn far more than employees, pound for pound. However, it can be a good starting point—it''s the calculation I made when I was deciding whether or not quit my job.</p>\n<p>If you''re just getting started with freelancing part time, your MAR is more a case of how highly you value your own time. You need to work for an amount of money that puts you in the right mindset to deliver an exemplary service. If you do anything less, you may deliver poor work and end up damaging your reputation. As you develop as a freelancer, your MAR may increase based upon how much you <em>want</em> to earn, as opposed to how much you <em>need</em>.</p>\n<h3>Pricing Format</h3>\n<p>When it comes to deciding <em>how</em> you should price your services, start with this key understanding in mind—charging by the hour is one of the worst mistakes a freelancer can make. There are two key reasons for this.</p>\n<p><strong>It Limits Your Earning Potential</strong><br/>\nIf you charge by the hour, it will only be natural for you to work less efficiently than if you had priced on a per job basis. And given that you only have a certain number of hours available in the day, you are essentially capping your maximum earning potential. You can of course raise your hourly rates, but you will still only have the same number of hours to work with (literally and figuratively).</p>\n<p>If. on the other hand, you price on a per job basis, you are limited only by the speed in which you can complete your work. You will learn to work more productively, and in turn, will earn a higher equivalent hourly rate (and impress clients with your efficient style and quick turnaround).</p>\n<p><strong>It Clouds Your Clients'' Judgement</strong><br/>\nAn hourly rate is a big psychological hurdle for many prospective clients. The same job priced in two different ways can provoke wildly different reactions. Let me explain: Say you''re presented with the opportunity to write a 1,500 word article on a complex and technical topic that you just happen to be well-educated on. Given the nature of the content, the client is happy to pay $150 for the article. He assumes it will take 3 hours, and deems $50 to be a reasonable hourly rate (but you don''t know that).</p>\n<p>Consider these two different pricing approaches:</p>\n<ul><li>State that the article will cost $150 to produce.</li><li>State that the article will take you around an hour to produce, and will cost $150.</li></ul>\n<p>The client would happily accept option 1. He would almost definitely balk at option 2.</p>\n<p>It''s simple psychology—the perception of value. <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/" target="_blank">Chris Guillebeau</a> touched upon this in <a data-amazontag="lifehackeramzn-20" data-amazonasin="0307951529" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307951529/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=lifehackeramzn-20&amp;ascsubtag=[type|link[postId|5994064[asin|0307951529"><i>The $100 Startup</i></a>. He paid $50 to a locksmith for an ultra-quick turnaround in an emergency, yet he felt shortchanged by the transaction. Chris remarked on his illogical reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…I realized that I secretly wanted him to take longer in getting to me, even though that would have delayed me further. I wanted him to struggle with unlocking my car as part of a major effort, even though that made no sense whatsoever. The locksmith met my need and provided a quick, comprehensive solution to my problem. I was unhappy about our exchange for no good reason.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our theoretical client would feel illogically unhappy about pricing option 2, in the same way as Chris did about his locksmith experience. The difference is this: most people don''t have Chris'' presence of mind to understand their illogical reasoning. Your competence and the speed at which you are able to do you work can have a huge impact on your bottom line. Don''t undercharge yourself by charging by the hour just because you happen to be good at what you do and can do it quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h3>Service Value</h3>\n<p>It is always important to view your work through your client''s eyes and from a commercial perspective. Consider this: how will your work benefit the client? How will it positively affect their bottom line? The answer to this question dictates in part the amount you can charge. For instance, an article for a small business blog is likely to have a relatively limited impact. If on the other hand, if you''re writing copy for a huge multinational corporation, the benefit of your services could be enormous. You should price accordingly.</p>\n<p>Bear this in mind when developing your freelancing business. When possible, place your services in what I like to call &quot;huge client benefit areas.&quot; Instead of writing blog posts for small clients (small client benefit), migrate your services to high-end blog editing for <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/top100/" target="_blank">Technorati 100</a> blogs (huge client benefit). Instead of designing logos for local businesses (small client benefit), work as a design consultant for Fortune 500 companies (huge client benefit). Such ideas may seem outlandish at this point in your career, but it''s amazing where endeavor and planning can take you.</p>\n<h3>The Competition</h3>\n<p>What you can charge depends to a large extent on how much your competition charges. But what are they charging? Can you find out? Many freelancers post their rates on their websites. You might even consider asking them—the worst they can do is tell you to sling your hook. Furthermore, how good area they? How does their experience compare with yours?</p>\n<p>In essence, the overruling question is this: where do you fit in with the competition? Are you nearer to the bottom or the top of the scale? The answer to this question dictates how aggressively you should set your rates.</p>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="960" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaf2yunvx9yjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>\n<h3>Supply and Demand</h3>\n<p>I recently negotiated an improved rate with a client of mine. However, it wasn''t as high as I wanted it to be. But I couldn''t argue with her point of view:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Writers are, I gotta be honest, insanely easily to come by for very few dollars indeed…given that my background is in writing, it''s pretty scary. I''ve got friends who are Financial Times journalists that are increasingly shitting themselves! I mean, it''s great for the company and all that, but not for quality folk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don''t agree with her clear implication that you can''t make money writing. However, I don''t doubt for a moment that she can find an abundance of cheap writers for the type of content her blog produces. My point is this: an abundance (or dearth) of other freelancers like you has a hefty impact on the rate you can set. And here''s the kicker: the lower the quality of work you do, the higher the supply of similar freelancers is. So be aware of supply and consider how it can affect your rate. But most importantly, work hard to get yourself above the first few rungs of the ladder as quickly as possible—otherwise you will always be dealing with negotiations like the above.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, consider the demand specific to you. Do people approach you by referral? Do they seek you out specifically because they like your work? Such prospective clients are likely to value your work far more highly than those that you seek out.</p>\n<h3>Indirect Benefits</h3>\n<p>When setting or negotiating a rate (and/or considering your MAR), it is important to not think solely about financial compensation. Take the client mentioned above. I continue to work for her, even though I get paid an equivalent hourly rate of about half as much as every single other client I have.</p>\n<p>Why? Because of the indirect benefits. Namely the following:</p>\n<ul><li>It is an authoritative blog, which is good for my reputation.</li><li>The byline under each of my articles drives traffic to my blog.</li><li>The work is consistent and secure (i.e. I trust her).</li></ul>\n<p>There are many more indirect benefits that can affect the rate you would be happy to accept, such as potential (could the work lead to greater things?), and referrals (e.g. a client in a new sector). Bear them in mind.</p>\n<h3>Negotiating</h3>\n<p>Negotiation is something that comes fairly naturally to me. I worked in property management and development in my previous life, and was no stranger to seven figure negotiations. That may well be why I have no difficulty in negotiating with freelance clients on what are, by comparison, minuscule deals.</p>\n<p>But that doesn''t detract from my firm belief that negotiating does not have to be a terrifying prospect. Whilst the common perception seems to be that clients are after a cheap deal, I have found that not to be the case, for the most part. This could be a side-effect of the forward-thinking blogging culture I generally operate in, but you only have to see how well my friend <a href="http://www.ruthzivecopywriting.com/" target="_blank">Ruth</a> is doing to see how handsomely corporate clients are prepared to pay.</p>\n<p>With that said, let''s delve into the world of negotiation for freelancers.</p>\n<h3>The Scope of Works</h3>\n<p>Always be certain of the scope of the job you are pricing. I cannot stress that enough. A freelancer''s worst nightmare is a misunderstanding between them and a client regarding the scope of the works. This can lead to a faltering relationship, and extra hours allocated to a job that you did not budget for. Make sure that you come to an agreement on the precise nature and scope of the work. If the job is to be more of a work in progress, come to a temporary agreement with the client, on the basis that a firm contract will be agreed for the long term at a future date.</p>\n<p>But whatever you do, make sure that you come to a unambiguous long term agreement regarding the nature of the work. This can be in the form of an email exchange, or a formalized contract. The point is that you must be able to clearly demonstrate that you have delivered exactly what the client asked for.</p>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="427" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18kaf2ozmfeyvjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>\n<h3>Pricing a Job</h3>\n<p>The key to pricing a job is to break it down into its constituent parts. Once you have segmented a job, allocate a conservative time frame to each part (plus contingency). Add up all the elements, and consider adding an overriding contingency. The client is more likely to negotiate than not, and many will feel that they are being hard done by if they don''t get the price knocked down at least a little (regardless of whether or not the price represents true value). So be sure to price your job accordingly.</p>\n<p>What is hopefully clear at this point is that all of the above factors should be taken into account when pricing a job. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>\n<ul><li>What service value am I offering?</li><li>What are my competitors charging?</li><li>How competitive is the market in which I am operating?</li><li>How strong is the supply/demand for work of this type?</li><li>Are there any indirect benefits relating to working with this client?</li></ul>\n<p>Your MAR is your bottom line. The key now is in making a proposal that strikes a balance between maximizing your earning potential, and not scaring the client off.</p>\n<p>Worst case scenario, your prospective client sees your price, and walks away. The likelihood of this is small, unless you have really priced yourself out of the market (in which case, you need to go back to the drawing board in terms of analyzing what you deem to be a reasonable rate). It is far more likely that they will attempt to negotiate you down, which is where the conservatism you built into your price comes into play.</p>\n<p>How hard you choose to negotiate above your MAR is essentially down to how much you want the job. Do you have lots of work booked? Can you afford to play hardball? Or, are you in need of any and all work at or above your MAR? Consider your situation and negotiate accordingly. Remember, so long as the equivalent hourly rate is above your MAR, the additional pay represents the potential for a boosted income. It is not the difference between life and death. If you are genuinely in need of the work, don''t try to get too cute with your negotiations.</p>\n<h3>Your Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>If your client attempts to negotiate below your MAR, you have one of three options:</p>\n<ul><li>Accept</li><li>Stand your ground</li><li>Negotiate the scope of works</li></ul>\n<p>Option 1 is only to be considered if you feel that the indirect benefits associated with the job outweigh the difference between the actual equivalent hourly rate and your MAR. I have a client who is a prime example of this. They pay me a little under my MAR, but I get a free link back to this blog in return, which makes up for it. After all, I expend plenty of energy in promoting this blog without any financial reward, so getting paid to do the same can''t be a bad thing, can it?</p>\n<p>Option 2 should be taken if you are comfortable that your MAR should not be breached for the job at hand—a straightforward decision if there are no indirect benefits.</p>\n<p>Option 3 represents a compromise in service delivery, and I am not keen on it. It can often lead to client dissatisfaction, and a fractured relationship.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, I will stick with option 1. After all, if they are not willing to pay what keeps a roof over your head, why on earth would you want to work for them? Finally, if a client plays hardball and you find yourself saying &quot;I might be willing to work for a little less,&quot; it may be time to reassess your MAR.</p>\n<h3>Retainers</h3>\n<p>In my opinion, you should never request a retainer (unless the job is particularly large and will require a lot of upfront investment). Nothing screams &quot;I don''t trust you&quot; more than requesting a retainer. It is not a good way to start what will hopefully be a profitable long term relationship.</p>\n<p>Instead, vet your clients appropriately. If you are uncomfortable with the proposed payment terms, suggest a shorter payment period over a probation period, followed by a permanent long term agreement (if applicable to the scope of works). Finally, understand that the occasional non-paying client is a cost of business. The sooner you accept that, the better.</p>\n<h3>Rates Are Not Permanent!</h3>\n<p>Budding freelancers are often paralyzed into inaction when it comes to setting rates. But remember this: each client is only one client, and rates are never permanent. In negotiating a rate with a client, the worst outcome is that you lose that client. It''s not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>I''ve said the following to new clients on more than one occasion: Let''s start with this, and take stock after a few articles to see how expectations match reality in terms of the scope of works.</p>\n<p>I have never had a client react negatively to this. The answer has always been something along the lines of, &quot;that seems fair&quot; (because it <em>is</em> fair—for both parties). If you act towards your client in such a way that demonstrates your trust, they are far more likely to want to work with you, than try to rip you off. And if you are totally transparent in the way you do business, they will want to work with you in the long term.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the key to setting and negotiating rates successfully (beyond your reading of this article) is simply to do it. The more clients you negotiate with, the more experienced and capable you will be come. It''s that simple.</p>\n<p class="arrow"><a href="http://www.leavingworkbehind.com/freelancing-setting-negotiating-rates/" target="_blank">Freelancing: a Complete Guide to Setting and Negotiating Rates</a>?Leaving Work Behind</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><i style="font-size:80%">Tom Ewer is the founder of <a href="http://www.leavingworkbehind.com/" target="_blank">Leaving Work Behind</a>, a blog that helps people quit their jobs and build profitable online businesses.

Pull all of your screwdrivers out of your tool box or bucket. I have about 20 in total. Each one is marked on the end of the handle with a white tag, and that white tag has a + or - sign on it. Taping the paper tags on each only takes a few minutes. Saves lots of time in the long run. In my tool box I keep Phillips on one side of the drawer, standard on the other side.</p>\n<p>When someone wants a Phillips I can easily grab 5 or 6 so they can take their choice of sizes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I''d argue it''s also worth investing in a screwdriver with removable heads, so you just have one screwdriver that fits all your needs. If you already have a sizable collection, though, this is one way to get it under control a bit. <i style="font-size:80%">Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/emil_kabanov/6254307843/" target="_blank">Emilio_13</a></i>.<br/></p>\n<associate></associate>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18k8sq0r021xrjpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p>\n<h3>Check the Shower When You''re Hunting Apartments</h3>\n<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/people/hammy_sammy">Hammy_sammy</a> reminds us of an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tips/forum?post=58829097">oft-neglected test</a> for new apartments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When hunting for an apartment, remember to ask how well the shower works (fixtures, drain, how fast the hot water heats, etc). If you''re super busy (like myself), dealing with a partially-functional shower can be a huge drag. When you preview the apartment, ask whoever''s showing you the place if you can turn the shower head on for a couple minutes. That way you can test it for yourself.

(179, 6, 'You Only Live Up to the Standards You Set', 'http://lifehacker.com/5993990/you-only-live-up-to-the-standards-you-set', '<p class="has-media media-640"><img height="360" width="640" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18k7t4s1lgtg2jpg/ku-xlarge.jpg" class="transform-ku-xlarge"/></p><p class="first-text">While I''m not one to advocate many personal development hacks, there is one &quot;hack&quot; that I think everyone should use: have high standards for yourself. Having high personal standards will almost immediately force personal growth, and will help you live up to your potential day after day. It''s also <em>really</em> simple to execute. </p>\n<h3>Be Ruthless With Yourself</h3>\n<p>If you''re anything like me, although you enjoy improving yourself (mentally, physically, whatever), you probably view yourself as a work in progress. As such, you may not think very highly of yourself. While being humble is certainly a great trait, it''s often misused. Simply being humble and viewing yourself in a negative light won''t help you achieve personal growth—if anything, it will slow your development. By constantly thinking down on yourself, you''re conditioning yourself to accept lower standards and mediocrity—the exact opposite of what you want to accomplish. If you''d like to become a better person, you need to constantly push yourself to achieve more, behave better, and learn to consistently outperform past versions of yourself.</p>\n<p>One foolproof way to aggressively pursue personal growth is to hold yourself to a high set of personal standards, then ruthlessly strive to live up to your own expectations. As you continue to strive towards your high personal standards, you''ll make quick gains that would have come slowly otherwise. I''ve found that when I''m under pressure (from myself) to act or live up to a certain standard, it''s much easier for me to accomplish my goals.</p>\n<h3>Develop High Standards</h3>\n<p>If you''ve never formally listed what your personal goals are, you should take a few minutes to do so now. Create a Google doc named Growth, and make a list of the following:</p>\n<ul><li>Traits you''d ideally like to have.</li><li>Ways you''d like to behave.</li><li>People who you respect.</li></ul>\n<p>For instance, if you''d like to always live up to your word, you may want to write something along the lines of:</p>\n<ul><li>Honor my commitments, regardless of external factors.</li><li>Carefully think things through before agreeing to do things.</li></ul>\n<p>Or, if you''d like to improve in a more physical way, set specific (and difficult to reach) goals:</p>\n<ul><li>Have 20-inch biceps, 40-inch quads, and 60-inch chest measurements.</li><li>Run a mile in 5 minutes flat.</li><li>Squat 1,000 lbs.</li></ul>\n<p>By clearly stating your goals and ideal behaviors, you set a clear precedent for yourself to follow and live up to. From this point on, refer to your list frequently to remind yourself what you''re aiming to accomplish, and why it matters to you.</p>\n<p>Note: Keeping a list of people who inspire you is important because it motivates you to be more like those people you look up to so much.</p>\n<h3>Respect Yourself</h3>\n<p>Once you''ve clearly defined the person you want to become, working towards your ideal self becomes that much easier. Respect yourself for striving to reach difficult goals, and think highly of yourself as you work to better yourself. Having respect for yourself makes it easier for you to make difficult decisions. We''re all defined by our actions, and those of us who have precise, measurable goals and a sufficient quantity of self-respect can more easily make the tough decisions that either push us forward or pull us back.</p>\n<p>What will you do when you''re sitting at a restaurant with your friends and you''re offered that sweet dessert? Will you eat it? Is that what you''d ideally do? What would future you do in this situation? Which decision will push you further towards your ideal self?</p>\n<p>Set high standards, ruthlessly pursue your goals, and respect yourself.</p>\n<p>Achieve great things, my friends.</p>\n<p class="arrow"><a href="http://www.rdegges.com/high-standards/" target="_blank">High Standards</a> | Randall Degges</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><i style="font-size:80%">Randall is a programmer, entrepreneur, speaker and author.

Some people tell me I can get more bang for my buck with two midrange cards, but others say I should get one high-end card instead. Which is true? </p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br/>\nDual Card Dude</p>\n<p>Dear Dual,<br/>\nUsing two (or more) video cards in tandem—known as &quot;SLI&quot; for NVIDIA cards and &quot;Crossfire&quot; for AMD cards—can get you better performance, sometimes even for less money than you''d spend on a comparable single card solution. However, whether it''s worth it is another story. Here''s what you need to know.</p>\n<h3>How SLI and Crossfire Work</h3>\n<p>To run SLI or Crossfire on your system, you need a few things: a compatible motherboard, two compatible video cards, and a &quot;bridge&quot; that connects the two cards together (these usually come with your motherboard or video cards). In SLI, you need two cards that have the same GPU—for example, two GTX 560 Tis. They don''t have to be from the same manufacturer, they just have to both be GTX 560 Tis. Crossfire has a bit more wiggle room, allowing you to pair some GPUs with other similar cards—like a Radeon 7950 with a Radeon 7970. To see which cards are compatible with one another, check out <a href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/sli" target="_blank">NVIDIA''s SLI page</a> and <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/AMDCrossFireFAQ.aspx" target="_blank">AMD''s Crossfire page</a>. Tom''s Hardware also has a <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/245454-33-crossfire-faqs" target="_blank">great FAQ</a> if you''re interested in finding out more.</p>\n<p>Once you install both cards and the necessary bridge, you can open up your driver''s control panel and enable SLI or Crossfire. Make sure your drivers are up to date and play a game—if your drivers support SLI or Crossfire for that game, you''ll notice a significant performance boost. It won''t be exactly twice the performance, and every game will be a little different, but in many games you should find that everything runs more smoothly—with some exceptions.</p>\n<h3>The Pros and Cons of Multiple Video Cards</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitAllowFullScreen="webkitAllowFullScreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" class="youtube" height="360" width="640" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZphJB5cUNKE?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0" id="youtube-ZphJB5cUNKE"></iframe></span></p><p>  So why would you run multiple video cards? The main reason people go for it is its price to performance ratio. It varies from card to card, but in some cases, running two mid-range cards is slightly cheaper than running one comparable high-end card. You can get the same performance for a few bucks cheaper. They''re also ideal for multi-monitor or high-resolution gaming. Plus, they look <em>sweet</em>, and some people just want to make their rig look as baller as possible.</p>\n<p>So that sounds awesome, right? Unfortunately, running multiple cards comes with some cons. For example:</p>\n<ul><li>Two video cards sitting closely together in your case will draw more power, produce more heat, and produce more noise. If you''re concerned about any of those things, SLI and Crossfire may not be for you.</li><li>Not all games support SLI and Crossfire. This depends on your video driver, not the game itself. NVIDIA and AMD often update their drivers to include multi-GPU support for new games, but if one of your games <em>isn''t</em> supported, you''ll either have to deal with one GPU or tinker with your driver settings to get the game working yourself.</li><li>SLI and Crossfire can sometimes cause a phenomenon called <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-stutter-crossfire,2995.html" target="_blank">micro stuttering</a> that makes the video look a tad choppy. It can be particularly aggravating to some people, especially at lower framerates.</li></ul>\n<p>In short, using two video cards may require more attention and tweaking on your part, whether to compatibility issues, heat, or just dealing with micro stutter.</p>\n<h3>So Is It Worth It?</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="171" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18k7onv2wngyljpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p>We can''t tell you what will work for you, but I almost always try to go with a powerful single card rather than two cards in SLI or Crossfire. To me, it''s worth the extra $50 (or whatever it is) to have a card that works without system tweaks, without the extra noise, and without the chance of any micro stutter issues.</p>\n<p>However, there is another school of thought, that says you can buy a good card now, and SLI it later. Tom''s Hardware user <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/community/profile-501761.htm" target="_blank">phishy714</a> <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/317369-33-worth#7120859" target="_blank">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With a [single GTX 560 Ti], You will be playing new games on high settings with pretty good fps easily for the next year. . . Once you start noticing you CAN''T play them on high settings, that''s when you buy another GTX 560 Ti (which will be dirt cheap by then, probably around the $120 range) and SLI them. Your system will then easily do another year''s worth of games on HIGH settings.</p>\n<p>After that, when your GPU is two generations old, that''s when you scrap them both and get a new card.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This still means you''ll have to deal with the cons of SLI, but it allows you to wait a little bit longer before dropping wads of cash on a brand new card—you can buy an older card for cheap and eke more performance out. Of course, you could always just sell your old card on eBay and buy another single, high-end GPU too, which will save you the trouble of SLI and Crossfire.</p>\n<p>In the end, it''s all about how much work you want to do. Some dual-GPU configurations may not require any work, but it''s hard to know that out of the gate—you always run the risk of having more work when you get multiple cards. But in some cases, it may be worth the trouble.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br/>\nLifehacker</p>\n<p><i style="font-size:80%">Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greggman/3087230463/" target="_blank">Gregg Tavares</a></i>.</p>\n<p><em style="color:#777; font-size:80%;">Have a question or suggestion for Ask Lifehacker?

Even the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone will have a built-in fitness tracker. Whether they actually do any good is a hotly debated issue. Let''s take a look at the types of people who benefit the most from fitness tracking gadgets and apps, and how how you can make yours work best for you. </p>\n<p>Most fitness gadgets and apps are actually quite good at tracking your activity level. They''ve gone from simple pedometers to gadgets that can track floors climbed, calories burned, and even <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993005/five-best-sleep-tracking-gadgets-or-apps">track your sleep</a>. The latest models can measure your heart rate, sync wirelessly, rally your friends to support you, and more. Plus, they''re affordable—most hover around $100, and most apps are free. It''s no wonder that doctors recommend them to their patients (mine included), and their popularity has exploded. Eventually, they''ll be everywhere: in our phones, embedded in our clothing, built in to our shoes.</p>\n<p>Even so, the picture isn''t all rosy. How many of your friends who obsessively tweet their latest Withings Scale weigh in or Fitbit daily progress score are actually making progress to their fitness goals? As soon as the luster wears off, we''re back to our old habits. So how do we make the most of these tools, and benefit from the data they provide without falling off the wagon? We talked to Dick Talens, Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.fitocracy.com/" target="_blank">Fitocracy</a>, and Derek Flanzraich, CEO and Founder of <a href="http://greatist.com/" target="_blank">Greatist</a>, to find out.</p>\n<h3>Quantifying Yourself Is Not the Same As Improving Yourself</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="352" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18k78wdsnfd3yjpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self" target="_blank">Quantified Self</a> movement seeks to use technology to document and analyze a person''s day to day activities in order to jump start positive change in their lives. We''re <a href="http://lifehacker.com/quantified-self">pretty big fans of it here</a>. After all: Accurate, externally-collected data is objective truth. You see what you''re <em>actually</em> doing, not what you''d like to be doing, or what you wish you were doing. That information can be powerful encouragement to get off the couch and hit the gym, or go for a run. <em style="font-size: 80%;">Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yto/8263196958/" target="_blank">Tatsuo Yamashita</a>.</em></p>\n<p>For example, in matters of diet, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5964540/keep-a-daily-food-diary-to-track-your-diet-lose-weight-and-build-healthy-habits">studies have shown keeping a food log</a> actually makes us more concious about what we eat, just because we''re paying attention. That alone makes us stop, think, and make better decisions. When our own Adam Pash <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5831306/how-i-got-in-shape-with-the-help-of-technology">got in better shape with the help of technology</a>, he explained that he was already motivated to make a change. He let his desire to get in shape and his love of data merge into an unstoppable force that kept him driven and motivated, turning into a feedback loop that fit in with his habits.</p>\n<p>The problem with quantifying yourself, as even advocates of the movement will tell you, is that tracking every little bit of information is just the beginning. Next, you have to examine the data and actually <em>make</em> the changes required to improve your life. Part of your motivation may come from playing your life like a game, making changes to improve your &quot;stats&quot; and make the numbers look better. Some of the motivation may come from the stark reality of the numbers in front of you, and the message they carry. Here''s the catch: <em>all of those sources of motivation have to exist prior to the start of data collection</em>.</p>\n<h3>Some Feedback Is Better Than No Feedback At All</h3>\n<p class="has-media media-640"><span class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitAllowFullScreen="webkitAllowFullScreen" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" class="youtube" height="360" width="640" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wQLHwSphu-M?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0" id="youtube-wQLHwSphu-M"></iframe></span></p><p> If you''re the type who feels data is its own reward, fitness tracking tools are great for you. They fit into <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5948871/master-the-habit-loop-to-break-bad-habits-and-build-better-ones">the habit loop</a>, which consists of a cue, a routine, and a reward. Unfortunately, not all of us love data enough to feel rewarded by it, and many people who invest in tracking gadgets give up as soon as the &quot;new shiny toy&quot; aspect of it (and the data it collects) wears off. In some cases, it can actually be counterproductive.</p>\n<p>The type of activity that fitness tracking gadgets and apps encourage you to do (and spend <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5662132/youve-got-a-limited-supply-of-willpower-so-use-it-wisely">their limited willpower</a> on) may not help in the long term. Dick pointed to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002517" target="_blank">this study in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em></a>, and explained: &quot;The activity that most people partake in with a Fitbit can be characterized as ''Low Intensity Steady State'' or LISS cardio. When people lose weight via LISS cardio, their metabolism adjusts and they actually need to keep that same amount of cardio up just to maintain their weight.&quot; Otherwise, he said, you''ll just put the pounds back on.</p>\n<p>There''s more though: <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/167/" target="_blank">A recent study of diabetes patients</a>, a category of people who have been told to use self-monitioring and testing gadgets to keep up with their health for over 30 years, showed that many eventually came to see their self-testing as &quot;the enemy,&quot; and it made them <em>less</em> interested and engaged with their health, not more. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/the-diabetics-paradox/274507/" target="_blank">This report on the issue in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> notes that in a vaccum, self-tracking can turn from empowerment tool to weighted shackles in short order.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, using a fitness tracking gadget in isolation—that is, just looking at it on your own and hoping for motivation to be more active and improve your health—isn''t always enough to make you healthier. All isn''t lost, though: there are some ways to use your fitness tracking gadget to actually improve your health.</p>\n<h3>How to Make the Most of Your Fitness Tracking Gadget or App</h3>\n<p>By now, we''ve taken the shine off of fitness tracking gadgets and apps so you see them for what they are: data collection tools. So how can you make the most of them and the data they provide? Here are a few suggestions:</p>\n<h4 class="modfont"><strong>Get Your Friends Involved</strong></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="357" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18k7bf57u02pxjpg/ku-medium.jpg" class="transform-ku-medium"/></p><p> Both Dick and Derek explained that being social—that is, joining or getting into a community of people who will encourage you, is the best, fastest, and most significant way to get and stay on the course to better health. This is why people with trainers, couples who get in shape together, and workout buddies have more success than people who work out alone. Derek notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my opinion, I''m convinced the killer app for health and fitness tracking is social. That''s what I think can take health tracking to the next level, where regular people care. If we can do something fun with it, compete or work together to achieve certain goals with it, then we''ll forget about the numbers and instead just focus on getting healthier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dick explained that this is partially the philosophy behind Fitocracy, and services like it that both compete with and complement fitness tracking tools. Eventually, the fun of logging steps, collecting badges, and maximizing stats wears off, and when it does, the community is still there to help push you forward and compare those stats with you. <em style="font-size: 80%;">Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikebaird/2900211213/" target="_blank">Mike Baird</a>.</em></p>\n<p>I''m a big fan of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5893162/how-to-work-towards-and-achieve-your-goals-in-public">working towards your goals in public</a>, but when it comes to fitness, you''ll have to do more than just tweet your weigh-ins to try and shame yourself into losing weight, or having your Fuelband post your daily stats to a public page where all of your friends on the site can see:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Find like-minded people and really engage them</strong>. Talk to them, work out with them, share your workout plans with them, and discuss what works and what doesn''t. Get a workout buddy, or convince your best friend or spouse to get the same gadget and compete with you. Whether it''s <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5841439/five-best-fitness-tracking-web-sites-and-services">an online community</a>, a private Google+ circle or Facebook group, or even a mailing list of your closest family and friends, get people to help you out who''ll be vested in your success.</li><li><strong>Get people invested in your success</strong>. If you do post your stats and steps publicly, make sure you get friends and family to encourage you and coach you—broadcasting doesn''t help anyone, but getting friends and family really involved with what you''re going goes much further. Leverage the communities in these apps and around these gadgets. There''s a reason why people who train for marathons solicit donations from friends and report on their training progress. It works.</li></ul>\n<h4 class="modfont"><strong>Make Your Tracking Gadget or App Part of a Bigger Package</strong></h4>\n<p class="has-media media-300"><img height="390" width="300" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18k7c2rm7dwoajpg/original.jpg" class="transform-original"/></p><p> Your fitness tracking gadget and your Wi-Fi scale (both of which I own, mind you) shouldn''t be the beginning and the end of your fitness journey:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Choose tools that work well together</strong>. When I went shopping for a fitness tracking gadget, I wanted one that had a webapp (so I could use it on any system) and supported both iOS and Android (since I own an Android phone and an iPad). I settled on the Fitbit, but you should pick the one that has the features that matter to you the most. If you plan to track your diet and nutrition, make sure you pick a tool that works well with the app or service you use for that (I use <a href="http://loseit.com/" target="_blank">LoseIt</a>, which plays very nicely with my Fitbit and my Withings Scale). If you like to run, make sure your running tool plays nicely with everything else. You see what we mean. If you wind up with five different apps to log in to and services to enter data into every day, you increase the odds you''ll never use any of them, or at least give up on one of them.</li><li><strong>Share your data with experts</strong>. Remember, exercise and nutrition are individual sciences, and there''s no one-size-fits-all diet or exercise plan that works for everyone. If you have access to a nutritionist or a fitness coach, share your data with them so they can see your progress. Get feedback from them on what you''re doing right or wrong, and what you should try doing. Talk to your doctor to see if the types of exercises you''re doing are right for you. Show them your food log and ask if the reason your progress has slowed has something to do with your diet. Even if you don''t have quick access to a nutritionist or a personal trainer, some of the communities we''ve mentioned have a wealth of knowledgeable people who understand the importance of helping one another.</li></ul>\n<h3>Don''t Try to Improve Your Health in a Vacuum</h3>\n<p>Fitness tracking gadgets and apps have a lot of potential, but the science on them is mixed and lagging behind their explosion in popularity. Early reports are that our relationship with them is like it is with any piece of exercise equipment: We buy it because it''s shiny and we have the best intentions, but eventually it''ll end up dusty and in a corner because it doesn''t solve the real problem that led us to the need to get in shape.</p>\n<p>The core mechanic that you have to address is motivation. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5950484/how-to-motivate-yourself-into-an-exercise-routine-youll-actually-stick-to">We''ve shown you how to motivate yourself into a routine you''ll stick to</a>, and explained how important it is to find people and communities that will help you stay motivated, cheer you on from the sidelines, and help you get moving again when you falter. Self-tracking has huge potential to be part of that habit loop—offering valuable data and insight into your progress, and even helping reward you for your efforts.</p>\n<p>When used in combination with the things that do work, and as part of a bigger plan to improve your health, they can be valuable. However, on their own and without any of the other pieces of the puzzle, you should be wary. Otherwise they''ll end up like that treadmill in the basement you''ve been meaning to dust off.</p>\n<p><em style="font-size: 80%;">Richard Talens is the Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at <a href="http://www.fitocracy.com/" target="_blank">Fitocracy</a>, a fitness tracking site and social network that''s makes tracking your exercise a real-world game that''s fun to play.
